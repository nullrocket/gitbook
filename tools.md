## **How To Get a Suggestion for a Password**

The **Password Suggestions** tool \(sometimes called a Password Generator\) is a way to quickly make passwords while adding a new entry, or updating a previous one.This tool simply invents new, unique passwords for you so that you do not have to think one up yourself. Please note: it does not set, update, or send the created password to the website in your entry \(this is a common misconception\).

To make a new password, just press the **Suggest** button in your entry window. A new window will popup, the _Password Suggestions_ tool. As soon as it opens, it will already have a suggested password for you:

* If you like the suggested password Press the **Use This** button and the password will be inserted into your entry. 
* If you do not like the suggested password You may change some of the settings, or just keep pressing the **Suggest** button until you get a password that satisfies you or press the **Cancel** button to close the password suggestions window \(no changes will be made to your entry\).

The suggested password can be copied and pasted wherever you'd like, or press the **Use This** button and it'll be inserted for you in the entry window. If you do not want to change your entry, press **Cancel**.

#### Change the Suggested Password Length

You may type in a number in the box to have Passpack generate a password for a specific length for you. For example, type "8" and an eight character password will be suggested, or type "40" for a forty character password. Alternatively, you can use the plus \(**+**\) and minus \(**-**\) buttons to the right of the box.

The minimum length is 1 character. The maximum length is 64 characters.

It is usually a good idea to check if there is a minimum or maximum password length limitation at the website you are creating a password for. Some websites \(unfortunately\) do not make this information readily available. Most websites accept between 6 and 12 characters.

Also, some websites have the bad habit of _seemingly_ accepting a long password, but in reality they only accept the first, for example, 12 characters. If this is the case, you usually won't notice until you try and login and they tells you your password is wrong. This doesn't depend on Passpack, but if you've recently generated a long password for that website, keep in mind this may be the case. Please contact the website owner.

#### Change Letters, Numbers and Symbols Settings

Use the check-boxes to decide what type of characters you would like the password to contain:

* **ABC** - will use some _UPPERCASE letters_ in the password
* **abc** - will use some _lowercase letters_ in the password
* **123** - will use some _numbers 0-9_ in the password
* **&%** - will use some _symbols_ like $;"!&/\(\)=&?\*\#@ in the password
* **���** - will use _accented letters_ and _characters from other alphabets_ in the password

When selected symbols or accented letters, you should first check if these are accepted by the at the website that you are creating a password for. Not all website accept them.

#### How to Create a Strong Password

Just because you use the **Password Suggestions** tool, does not automatically mean that the password you generate is strong. For example, if you it will generate a 1 character password for you if you tell it to - but that is definitely not strong.

It is best to create the longest password that the website accepts, and use symbols or accented letters if these are allowed. There is also a quality rating given for each password suggested, this should help you understand if your password is good enough for your purposes or not.

## **Bulk Editing Options**

With Passpack, you can edit, share or delete your passwords entries either one at a time, or in batches. You can access the bulk editing features in your **Passwords** tab and clicking on the link **Bulk editing your entries** located just underneath it.

####  Bulk Editing Actions

To apply an action to the entries you have selected, select an action from the Action menu to the top right of your selected password list. Your options are:

* Bulk share password entries
* Bulk assigning passwords to user groups
* Bulk transfer of ownership of password entries
* Bulk deleting password entries

 Yes, but you should use the import feature for that. [Instructions here](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200816690-Bulk-Editing-Options).

## **Using "Quick Filters"**



In your **Passwords** tab, to the left of your password list, you'll see the **Quick Filters** box. Clicking on any of the items in this box will temporarily change the entries being viewed in your list to only those you've selected. For example, if you'd like to only see your favorite entries \(ones you use frequently\), click **Favorites** in your **Quick Filter** box. It's very simple.

By default, it looks something like the image on the left. The image on the right shows a full **Quick Filter**box, including sharing options.

Clicking the small **show more** and **show less** link to the bottom right of the box, will expand or collapse the box.

The number in parenthesis is the number of entries that will be listed for each item.

* **All Unpacked Entries** For most people, this means _all_ of your entries. Clicking this will remove any previous filters. Users who have set up advanced startup options will only see those entries which have been unpacked.  
* **Favorites** Click on this to only see the entries that you've marked as favorites. If you do not have any favorites, the link will not be clickable.  
* **Security Level** Passpack allows you to set up to three security levels for your entries. This is option, and by default your passwords will be protected with the highest level available. Click the plus sign next to see the three different security levels. If you've changed the security level of any of your entries, click one of the options to list them.  
* **All shared, You shared & Shared with you** If you do not see these options - it's okay. that simply means that you are not sharing any of your passwords with anyone else, and no one is sharing their passwords with you. 
  * **All shared**  Will list passwords that either you are sharing with others, or they are sharing with you. Click the plus sign to see the names of all people involved in sharing. You may also then click on a person's name to see all entries shared between the two of you.
  * **You shared** Will only list your passwords that you have decided to share with other people.
  * **Shared with you** Will only list your passwords that you have received in sharing from other people. These entries are not yours, they are "lent" to you by others.

## **How to Copy a Hidden Password**

To protect your passwords from view of others, the password field in your Entry Window may be hidden \(or scrambled\). To view the password, press the _Show_ button.

To hide it again, press _Hide_. 

You can copy the password even when it is hidden simply by clicking on the scrambled looking field. This will automatically copy your password. You can then paste it wherever you need to.

## **How to Personalize Your Password List**



To change what columns you see in your password list, go to **Settings &gt; Appearance**.

By default, your password list will be pretty simple. In order, it contains the **Go** icon, the name of your entry \(you chose this\), the content icons, and the **favorites star icon**.

* Clicking the **Go icon** will take you to the website.
* Clicking one of of the **content icons** will copy it. In the example above, you'd click the password icon \(the little asterik\) to copy your amazon password. This is a shortcut.
* Clicking the **star icon** would mark this entry as a favorite.
* Clicking on the **name**, or anywhere else in the row would open the entry window where you can view or make changes.

Additional columns that you could add are the **security level icon**, and the list of **tags** you've assigned to that entry. ****
