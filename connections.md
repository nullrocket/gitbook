# Connections

## The People Tab

The **People** tab is where you manage your shared users. From here you can invite new people to connect, send them messages, and organize them into **Groups** for easier sharing \(Teams which replace Groups and allow for more flexibility are coming soon\).

**You must activate Passpack's Secure Sharing before you invite someone to connect. If you haven't yet, you will be prompted to activate it first.**

**\(1\)** Use the **Invite Someone** button to add a new person to your list. [Instructions here.](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200816630-How-to-Invite-People-to-Connect)

**\(2\)** This alphabetical order list is the main portion of the **People** tab. It lists of all the people you've connected with, or are in the process of connecting with. 

**\(3\)** The **Quick Filter** pane contains a few filters you can click on to quickly find people. Some options:

* **Everyone**, as the name implies, will remove any previous filters and show you everyone in your list.  
* **Your shared users** will show you only those users you have activated sharing for. These are the ones with the orange SHARING tag in front of the name. Free accounts are allowed 1 shared user.  
* **Sharing with you** will show you only those people that have activated sharing with you from within _their_ account. These are the ones with the black SHARING tag in front of the name. There is no limit on these.  
* If you have set up groups, you will also see a **Your groups** filter. Click the plus sign to expand the list of your groups, then click on one to show the people you have assigned to each.

**\(4\)** Click on a letter to only view names beginning with that letter. To undo, click **Everyone** in the **Quick Filters** pane above. If a letter is not clickable, there are no corresponding names. 

### Details & Controls

![](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200125109/peopledetail.jpg)

**\(1\)** If this person is one of your shared users, you will see an orange SHARING tag before the name. If, the other way around, the other person has added you as one of their shared users, then you will see a black SHARING tag. In the event you are not actively sharing with this person, there will be no sharing tag.   
  


While there is a limitation on the number of shared users you may have \(SHARING\), you can invite as many people as you'd like and an unlimited number of people may add you as a shared user \(SHARING\).

**You can always choose to send people in your list messages and copies of passwords, even if you don't see a sharing tag. The only thing you can't do is actively share password entries with them.**

**\(2\)** The name of the person. If you have renamed them in your list, that will show up. Otherwise, the person's _**Nickname**_ will be shown instead.**\(3\)** If you have renamed the person in your list, their original _**Nickname**_ will be in parenthesis here. Otherwise, this spot will be empty.

**\(4\)** The groups a person belongs to are listed horizontally here. Click the **X** icon next to any group to remove that person immediately from the group. See **\(9\)** for how to assign a person to a group.

**\(5\)** Click **Delete** to completely remove the person from your **People** tab. All sharing will be immediately revoked, any password entries that you have shared with this person will disappear from their account and any password entries they have shared with you will disappear from your account. If you had assigned the person to any groups, they will also be automatically removed from those groups.You can also use **Stop Sharing** **\(8\)** to achieve the same effect, however by deleting a person you will _also_ no longer be able to exchange messages with them \(nor them with you\) unless you go through the invitation process all over again.

**\(6\)** This is useful, for example, when the person's _Nickname_ is something that you would have a hard time identifying as belonging to them. Click **Rename** if you'd like to change the name of the person as it appear in your list. The _Nickname_ will become editable. Type the name as you'd prefer to see it and press **OK** when you've finished, or **cancel** to leave it as-is. 

**\(7\)** The **Send Message** link is a shortcut to your **Messages** tab.

**\(8\)** When you press **Start Sharing**, the person will become one of your shared users \(SHARING\). From that point onward, you can both share as many password entries with each other as you'd like.

Once sharing has been started, the link will change to read **Stop Sharing** with the number of password entries that are currently shared between the two of you in parenthesis. When you click **Stop Sharing** any password entries that you have shared with this person will disappear from their account and any password entries they have shared with you will disappear from your account. If you had assigned the person to any groups, they will also be automatically removed from those groups.

If you decide to start sharing with them again in the future, you'll have to set everything up again from scratch.

**\(9\)** Click **Add to Group** to assign the person to a group. You will only see this link if you are currently sharing with the person _and_ you have set up at least one group.

**You can choose to share password entries with entire groups and everyone in the group will instantly receive access. This saves time when sharing passwords with multiple people from the same team or department.**

## How to Invite People to Connect

Go to the People tab from within your Passpack account.

**Note that if you haven't activated Passpack's collaboration feature yet, you'll be prompted to do so. Follow these instructions then come back to this page once you're done.**

### What You'll Need

Make sure you know the _Nickname_ of the person you want to invite. Don't know it? Ask him - Passpack assumes you know each other well if you're going to be sharing passwords and exchanging super-secret messages. If the person you want to invite does not have a Passpack account yet, they will have to sign up first. Yes, we know that's a bit of a pain and we're working on som way to automate that for you.

### Send the Invite 

Click the **Invite Someone** button.

Type in your friends Nickname. Type it carefully.You'll not be prompted if the name you wrote doesn't exist; the same if your friend doesn't accept your invite. You'll receive a confirmation only if your invite is accepted.

Add a short note to your invite. This is to assure your friend that you're really _you_. Write something only the two of you can know \(ex. what drink you had the last time you went out together\).

### Preliminary Invite Chat

When your friend recieves your invite, they can choose to accept it right away, or they may ask you some more questions to make sure it's you. The ball is in their court - you can't force them to accept your invite unless you walk over to thier desk and threaten them \[wink\]. 

At any time, you can click the Manage Invite link next to the person's name in your _People_ tab. This chat should be used only to assure each other that you're adding the right person. Here are some actions you can take:

* If you originally sent the invite, and have since changed  your mind, press the Revoke Invitebutton. This will remove the person from youe _Person_ tab. They can no longer accept yor invite.
* If you received an invite that you would like to accept, press the Accept button.
* If you have received an invite that you do NOT want to accept, press the Refuse button.
* If you're not sure, press the Reply button to ask another question in your chat, then Send.

### All Done, Now What?

If you don't like the person's _Nickname_ they chose for themselves, you can rename them in your list. Click the**Rename** link under thier _Nickname_, type a name you prefer and press **OK**. You'll still be able to see thier official_Nickname_ in parenthesis.

Now you can send a message, send a password or start truly sharing with this person. Enjoy!

**Premium accounts, you can also organize your contacts into groups, and batch share passwords with those groups.**
