## **Lock It Up!**

In addition to the Auto-lock and Auto-save options that you can manage under your **Settings &gt; Packing & Saving** menu, you can also force Passpack to lock up and hide on command.

Should you ever need to leave your workstation unattended, just press the **Lock it Up!** button in the upper right hand corner of your screen. All you'll need is your _Packing Key_ to re-enter your account when you're ready.
