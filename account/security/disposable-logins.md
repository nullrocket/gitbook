#### **How Many Disposable Logins Can I Use Daily?**

You can use as many _Disposable Logins_ in a day as you'd like. The only restrictions are that they be used only once, and before they expire.

#### **How Do I Know When My Disposable Logins Expire?**

To see when they expire, go to **Settings &gt; Disposable Logins**. If you have any active Disposable Login they will be listed there. At the top of the list, it should say something like "_These Disposable Logins will expire in 11 hours and 59 minutes._"

If you do not see a list, it means that they have already expired, therefore you have none.

#### **Can I Use My Disposable Logins in Any Order?**

Yes, you can use them in any order you wish. You can choose any set of _Disposable Logins_ to use from your printed list. This means you can use them in random order if you would like too. Just cross it off when you are done, because \(of course\) they can only be used once.

It does not matter if you use them in random order, or use some, then login normally, then use some more. Your _Disposable Logins_ remain active until the expiration date, or until used.

#### **Can I Use a Disposable Login with OpenID?**

Not usually. Passpack's Disposable Logins are Password/Packing Key pairs that can not be used separately. If you use OpenID \(or other Third Party Login\*\) for authentication, then you do not have a Password and Passpack can not make a Password/Packing Key combination for you.

**\* Includes OpenID, Google, Yahoo, Hotmail, Facebook, FriendFeed, Twitter and Yubikey.**

#### An Alternative Solution

If you would like to be able to access your account with a Disposable Login, you must first set up a standard Passpack User ID and Password. You can do this under Settings &gt; Set User ID and Settings &gt; Set Password from inside your account.

You can then use either your OpenID or your standard User ID and Password to login. You have both options available to you. You may also then [set up your Disposable Logins](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200698865) under Settings &gt; Disposable Logins.**make more Disposable Logins when logged in with a Disposable Login?**

#### **What is a Disposable Login?**

A Disposable Login is a set of Password and Packing Key that you use once, and then it gets thrown away. You can not choose your _Disposable Logins_, they will be assigned to you.

Disposable Logins are sometimes referred to as "One Time Password" or OTP for short. However at Passpack you get more than just a single use password, you get a Password/Packing Key combination. This is why we prefer the name"Disposable Login" over OTP.

#### When to Use Disposable Logins

Disposable Logins are for use when traveling. They help protect your Passpack account when you connect from a computer that is not under your direct control \(like at an Internet point, library, client's office or computer lab\).

#### How Disposable Logins Protect You

Certain types of malevolent software - called keyloggers, or screenloggers - are able to capture your password as you type, or even record clicks on an on-screen keyboard. Since your Passpack account holds the keys to your kindgom, you should be very careful NOT to allow these programs to capture your Passpack Password and Packing Key.

By using a disposable Password/Packing Key pair, you will be able to protect your account from these keyloggers. Even if your Disposable Login were to get captured, it's completely useless since it only works ONCE \(the one time you used it\).**o Sign In with Disposable Logins**
