## Packing Key

Your Packing Key is a private encryption key that is used to encrypt/decrypt you passwords.

Passpack uses your User ID and Password to confirm you are the proper owner of your account \(sometimes called "authentication"\). Once that is done, Passpack will download your pack of passwords to your browser, where your Packing Key will be used to decrypt the pack. Then you can see your passwords.

Your passwords are "unpacked" directly on your computer your browser, then packed back up again before getting sent back to Passpack for storage.

### **How to Choose a Packing Key**

When choosing your Packing Key, remember: this is the key to your kingdom, so it should be strong. The minimum requirement is only 8 characters, but the longer the better. The fastest way to choose a strong Packing Key that is easy to remember is to use a complete sentence. Here are some examples:

* Chocolate ice cream is better than vanilla
* pink elephants on parade
* Mr. Bowler has a funny hat

Really, it's that easy!

You can change your Packing Key whenever you'd like by going to Account &gt; Change Packing Key from within your Passpack account. However, if you forget your Packing Key, it CAN NOT be recovered or reset.

### Minimum Requirements

Your _Packing Key_ must be at least 8 characters long and is also case sensitive. You can \(and should!\) use punctuation, numbers, foreign characters or even spaces. We suggest a quality rating of at least 80 \(optional\).
