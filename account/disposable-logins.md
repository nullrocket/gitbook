# Disposable Logins

A Disposable Login is a set of Password and Packing Key that you use once, and then it gets thrown away. You can not choose your _Disposable Logins_, they will be assigned to you. Disposable Logins are for use when traveling. They help protect your Passpack account when you connect from a computer that is not under your direct control \(like at an Internet point, library, client's office or computer lab\).

Disposable Logins are sometimes referred to as "One Time Password" or OTP for short. However at Passpack you get more than just a single use password, you get a Password/Packing Key combination. This is why we prefer the name"Disposable Login" over OTP.

Certain types of malevolent software - called keyloggers, or screenloggers - are able to capture your password as you type, or even record clicks on an on-screen keyboard. Since your Passpack account holds the keys to your kindgom, you should be very careful NOT to allow these programs to capture your Passpack Password and Packing Key.

By using a disposable Password/Packing Key pair, you will be able to protect your account from these keyloggers. Even if your Disposable Login were to get captured, it's completely useless since it only works ONCE \(the one time you used it\).**o Sign In with Disposable Logins**

## Disposable Login Setup

You should set up your Disposable Logins before traveling. It's very fast, but make sure you have a printer available. First, login to your Passpack account and go to Settings &gt; Disposable Logins. Press the Generate button and the screen will change.

**\(1\)** Use the plus \(+\) and minus \(-\) buttons to choose the number of _Disposable Logins_ that you want to create

**\(2\)** Use the plus \(+\) and minus \(-\) buttons to choose when they should expire.

**\(3\)** Press the Generate button.

When you're done, you will see the list of generated codes, press the **Print** button \(there is no way you will be able to memorize them - they look like a bunch of nonsense\). A tiny, anonymous looking window will open. Print it as you normally would.

**Store your printout in a safe place together with your travel documents, or clip it and put it in your wallet.**

## Expiration

To see when they expire, go to **Settings &gt; Disposable Logins**. If you have any active Disposable Login they will be listed there. At the top of the list, it should say something like "_These Disposable Logins will expire in 11 hours and 59 minutes._"

If you do not see a list, it means that they have already expired, therefore you have none.

## **Disposable Login and Third Party Logins?**

Not usually. Passpack's Disposable Logins are Password/Packing Key pairs that can not be used separately. If you use a Third Party Login for authentication, then you do not have a Password and Passpack can not make a Password/Packing Key combination for you.

### An Alternative Solution

If you would like to be able to access your account with a Disposable Login, you must first set up a standard Passpack User ID and Password. You can do this under Settings &gt; Set User ID and Settings &gt; Set Password from inside your account.

You can then use either your OpenID or your standard User ID and Password to login. You have both options available to you. You may also then [set up your Disposable Logins](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200698865) under Settings &gt; Disposable Logins.
