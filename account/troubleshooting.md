## Troubleshooting

##### **The sign in form tells me my User ID or Password are wrong.**

You may be mistyping one or both of them. They are case sensitive, so upper and lower case letters make a difference. For example: _Bob_, _bob_, _BOB_ and _bOb_ are considered completely different User ID's. You can recover \(and double check\) a User ID, or reset a forgotten password using this [self-service form](https://www.passpack.com/reset).

##### I don't get any error message, but when I press the Sign in button, nothing happens.

Please contact support. We'll need to know what browser version and type of computer you are using \(ex. Explorer 8 on Windows XP Home\).

##### The self-service form tells me my account does not exist.

This can be caused by several different issues.
* Your email address has not been confirmed.  When you initially set up you Passpack account you are sent an email asking you to confirm your address, if you chose not to set an email address or did not follow the supplied link then you will need to contact support to help you set an email address before you can use the password reset form.

* Perhaps you are using Passpack Desktop? The self-service password reset form is for Passpack.com online accounts only. Also, if you have not used your account in _over six months_, it may have been considered abandoned and automatically deleted.

* If none of these apply, please [contact support and tell us on _exactly_ what step you get stuck](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). We'll be happy to see if we can figure out what's wrong.
