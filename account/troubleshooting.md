## Troubleshooting

##### **It tells me my User ID and Password are wrong.**

You may be mistyping one or both of them. They are case sensitive, so upper and lower case letters make a difference. For example: _Bob_, _bob_, _BOB_ and _bOb_ are considered completely different User ID's. You can recover \(and double check\) a User ID, or reset a forgotten password using this [self-service form](https://www.passpack.com/reset).

##### I don't get any error message, but when I press the Sign in button, nothing happens.

Please contact support. We'll need to know what browser version and type of computer you are using \(ex. Explorer 8 on Windows XP Home\).

##### The self-service form tells me my account does not exist!**

Perhaps you are using Passpack Desktop? The self-service password reset form is for Passpack.com online accounts only. Also, if you have not used your account in _over six months_, it may have been considered abandoned and automatically deleted.

If none of these apply, please [contact support and tell us on _exactly_ what step you get stuck](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). We'll be happy to see if we can figure out what's wrong.
