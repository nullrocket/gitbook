### How to Change Your Packing Key

From within your Passpack account, go to Account &gt; Change Packing Key. You will be asked to insert your current Packing Key for security, and then to choose a new one. You will be asked to type it in twice to make sure you are typing it properly. The quality rating bar will help you make sure your Packing Key is strong. A confirmation message will tell you if the process was a success.
