### Where can I find my nickname for sharing?

Look in the uppermost left-hand corner of your screen when logged into your account. It should say

> Hi **YourUserID** \| _SomethingElse_

That _SomethingElse_ is the nickname you chose. If for some reason you don't see it there, go to the home tab. Next to the cube there's your User ID and underneath that is your nickname.

### How to activate secure collaboration features?

**Passpack offers password sharing, password sending and message sending features.** To use these features, you must activate Secure Collaboration \(it's not active by default\) then add people to your _People_ tab. You will need a _Nickname_ that people can recognize you by, so that you can invite each other to connect.

#### 1. Activate Collaboration

Once you are logged in, go to your Settings page and click Activate collaboration now! \(this will allow you to use sharing, messaging and password sending features\).

#### 2. Choose a Nickname

This is a name that your friends and co-workers should be able to recognize you by. Type it into the field provided and check the spelling twice because _you can not change it_.

You'll also have to answer a semi-technical question. Here's some help making that choice:

* Choose **Generate the keys server side** if you use Internet Explorer or have a slow computer. 
* Othersise, choose **Generate the keys in the browser**.  _When using this option, your browser may ask you Do you want to stop the script from running? Say NO and be patient .You only have to wait this long once during set up. Afterwards, ending messages and passwords will be instant. Otherwise, stop the process and choose Generate the keys server side instead._

**The first time you activate Secure Collaboration, you are actually telling Passpack to create a 1024bit RSA \(public and private\) key inside your browser. This is an asymmetric key algorithm which takes a while to generate. The RSA 1024 bit can result in slow Javascript processing depending on which browser you are using. Chrome and Safari can handle it with no problems, Firefox is a little bit slower, and Internet Explorer is slower than a snail on its deathbed \(that's why we give you the server side option as well\).**

#### 3. Invite Someone to Connect with You

The first time you invite a friend you will be asked to accept the Terms and Conditions. Take the time to read those few lines. It's only a one-time message.

#### How Many People Can I Connect With?

As many as you want! There's no limit. But remember: you're on Passpack, sending secure messages and passwords to and from "real life" people. There's no need to accumulate 300 friends, unless you plan on sending passwords to them all \[smile\].

#### What About Sharing? Is That the Same As Inviting Friends?

No, it's not the same.

There is a difference between simply having connected with someone listed in your **People** tab, and actively sharing with another user. _All_ accounts can connect with as many people as they want, however the number of users you can actively share with depends on the type of account you have \(Free, Pro, Group or Team\).

### Choosing a nickname for collaboration?

**Passpack offers password sharing, password sending and message sending features.** To use these features, you must activate Secure Collaboration \(it's not active by default\) then add people to your _People_ tab. You will need a _Nickname_ that people can recognize you by, so that you can invite each other to connect.

When choosing your _Nickname_ please remember:

* You will not be able to change it later;
* It's the only way friends can add you to their _People_ tab;
* It is how you will be identified in all Passpack collaboration features: messaging, sending and sharing passwords.

So check the spelling twice before pressing **Ok**.

#### Why Can't I Just Use my User ID?

If you would like to use the same thing for both your User ID and your Nickname, that's ok. Technically though, Passpack considers them two different things.

While you can change your User ID in Passpack whenever you wish, Nickname never changes. Also, the User ID can be something like 'j\*'', whereas the Nickname is limited to letters, numbers, dashes, dots and underscores so as to be easily recognizable to the people on the receiving end.
