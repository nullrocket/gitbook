## How to Change Your Password

From within your Passpack account, go to Account &gt; Change Password. You will be asked to insert your Packing Key for security, and then to choose a Password. You will be asked to type it in twice to make sure you are typing it properly. The quality rating bar will help you make sure your Password is strong. A confirmation message will tell you if the process was a success.
