#Packing Key

Your packing key is an important part of securing your account. The Packing Key is used to decrypt your stored passwords. In order to ensure your passwords are safe no matter what happens, Packing Keys are not stored on our servers and all encryption/decryption happens on your computer. Passwords are never stored or transmitted without first being encrypted by your Packing Key.


 


###Choosing a Packing Key
During registration you will be prompted to create a Packing Key. Your Packing Key must be at least 8 characters long and is also case sensitive. You can (and should!) use punctuation, numbers or even spaces. We suggest a quality rating of at least 80 (optional).

{% hint style='tip' %}
You want your Packing Key to be as long and strong as possible. The easiest way to do that is to think of a sentence that only means something to you.

DO NOT forget your packing key. We will not be able to recover your data or reset your key
