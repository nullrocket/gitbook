# Standard Registration

Although you can use third party logins / social login providers to register, the recommended way of creating a Passpack account is to create a standard User ID / Password.

####Required information
Registration requires you to provide a few pieces of information depending on which registration method you use. 


1. **User ID**<br/>You will use your User ID to log into your Passpack account. Your User ID must be between 2 and 32 characters long and is case sensitive.

2. **Password**<br/>Your password must be at least 6 characters long and is also case sensitive. You can use punctuation, numbers or even spaces. Using a longer and more complex password will make your account more secure.

3. **Email Address**<br/>You can choose whether or not you want to give Passpack your email address, however we suggest you do as it is necessary in order for us to provide you with account recovery options and account notifications, **If you do not provide an email address, we will not be able to help you reset your password.**

4. **User Agreement & Privacy Policy**<br/>In order to use Passpack you will need to read and Accept the User Agreement and Privacy Policy . These two documents outline what you can expect from us and how your data will be handled.
