## Signing Up with Third Party Credentials
Passpack allows you to use an existing login from one of the supported providers as the login for your Passpack account. The standard Passpack Login is not required. However, some features do not work with Third Party Logins. For example, the remember me feature and Disposable Logins are available on standard Passpack logins only.

To use your Third Party Credentials, go to [https://www.passpack.com/online](https://www.passpack.com/online) and click on the provider's icon on the left, then follow the instructions that will appear in the Sign In dialog to the right.
