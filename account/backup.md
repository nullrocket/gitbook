# Backup

A back-up of your account is a  fully encrypted package of all your passwords and associated tags and notes. No one will be able to access the data in your backup file without your packing key. It is a good idea to periodically back up your passwords to safeguard against the unforseen.

Not everything about your account is included in your backup. check the following lists to see what you can expect to be saved and what is not.

#### Included

* Password Entries owned by this account
* Tags

#### Not Included

* Shared password entries that do no belong to the account
* Settings
* Messages
* Connections

## **Backup Your Passwords**

To make a backup, go to **Tools &gt; Backup** from within your account. Choose your backup key options \(see below\) then click Continue. Once your backup is ready to download, you should see a **Save to Disk **button. Click that button and your backup will download to your computer. That's it. Make sure you save your backup in a safe place, and that you remember where you put it.

### Selecting a Backup Key \(optional\)

By default, your Packing Key is used to do this encryption - but you can also set a different Backup Key if you'd like. If you're not sure, leave the default. Otherwise, select the I want to provide a different Backup Key option. The Backup Key is a key that is different from your Packing Key: setting a specific Backup Key can be useful is a variety of situations. The most common which comes to mind is when you want to move data between accounts:

You would make a backup with a Backup Key from the first account. Then, in the second account, use the restore function to fill that account with the backed up data. You can safely swap data this way with another person without revealing your usual Packing Key.

If you choose to use a Backup Key, two fields will appear. Type in the Backup Key that you'd like to use - it must have a quality rating of 64 or better \(actually 128 would be best\) then repeat it to make sure you haven't mistyped.

## Restore from Backup

Passpack allows you to restore your data from a personal backup at any time. Use this feature to recover data, or to securely transfer data between accounts. Go to **Tools &gt; Restore** from within your Passpack account.

**To use Restore, you need to have a backup, not an export. Backups and exports are different.**

**\(1\)** If your browser supports it, you'll see a browse button and you can choose to upload your backup file directly. Otherwise, if you don't see a browse button, you'll need to open your backup file with a simple text editor \(like notepad - not Word, Word won't work\) and copy and pasted the encrypted text into the blue box you'll see on screen.

**\(2\) Most of the time, you can leave this option as is, however there are three cases when you'll want to choose the The backup was encrypted using a specific Backup Key option:**

1. You've changed your Packing Key between when you made the backup and when you restore it -- use your old Packing Key as the Backup Key.
2. You're restoring a backup from a different account other than your own \(this is a good way to safely move large amounts of passwords back and forth between Passpack accounts\)
3. If you specifically set a Backup Key different from your Packing Key.

If you choose the Backup Key option, a field will appear. You can insert the Backup Key there.

**\(3\)** Press Preview. This will take you to the next screen.

### Preview and Confirm

Once you've chosen all of your options, press the Preview button. Make sure everything is as it should be, then press the Import button to proceed. If you do not press the Import button, nothing will be restored. When you're done, go to your Passwords tab and press the red Save All button.
