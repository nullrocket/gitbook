### How to print your login credentials?

If you are afraid you might forget your Passpack login information, you can print out a copy for the future. You can keep it in a safety deposit box so that it's secure \(so you won't need it everyday\) - but in an emergency, you'll have it.

To make a printout of your _User ID, Password and Packing Key_, enter your Passpack account. Click on your **Account** link \(on the right, between Tools and Help\). On the bottom of the left-hand column click the**print your Passpack login information link**. You will be asked to insert your Packing Key to confirm that you are sure. Click Continue.

When you have finished printing, press the **Back** button and you will return to your Passpack account.

### How to Change Your User ID

From within your Passpack account, go to Account &gt; Change User ID. You will be asked to insert your Packing Key for security, and then to choose a new User ID.  A confirmation message will tell you if the process was a success.

### How to Change Your Password

From within your Passpack account, go to Account &gt; Change Password. You will be asked to insert your Packing Key for security, and then to choose a Password. You will be asked to type it in twice to make sure you are typing it properly. The quality rating bar will help you make sure your Password is strong. A confirmation message will tell you if the process was a success.

### How to confirm and manage your email?

When you sign up for a Passpack account, you will be asked to provide an email. This is optional, but highly recommended. Without a confirmed email address emergency situations like forgot logins or account deletions cannot be dealt with.

#### How to Confirm Your Email

If you provided an email address during sign up, or once you provide one from within your account, a confirmation email will be sent to you. Click on the confirmation link provided and Passpack will automatically confirm your email for you.

If for some reason you are not able to, or do not want to, use the link in the email, you can manually confirm your email instead. From within your Passpack account, go to Account &gt; Confirm Your Email and paste in the Confirmation Code that was sent to you.

#### If You Did Not Receive the Confirmation Email

The confirmation email can take a few minutes to arrive. However, if you did not get the confirmation email within a reasonable amount of time then one of two things has likely happened:

1. The email got lost in the junk mail, or spam filter To remedy this, please add  noreply@passpack.com to your email address book, then go to Account &gt; Confirm Your Email, scroll down and press the Send Again button.  
2. You accidentally mistyped the email To remedy this, go to Account &gt; Confirm Your Email and scroll down to the last option. Insert your email again, double check that it is typed properly, then press the Change & Send button.

#### If You Did Not Provide an Email Upon Registration

To add your email address, go to Account &gt; Activate Your Email. Insert the email address you want to associate with your account, a confirmation email will be sent to the address provided.

#### How to Change the Email Associated with Your Account

If your email changes, please keep this updated in your Passpack account. Go to Account &gt; Manage Your Email. You will be asked to insert your Packing Key for security, and then to insert the new email address. A confirmation email will be sent to the address provided.

### How to set your packing and saving preferences?

You can decide how long your Passpack account stays inactive before it locks up. You can also set it to automatically save any changes you've made in the meantime. To set your preferences, go into your Settings &gt; Packing and Saving.

![](../.gitbook/assets/packingsaving.jpg)

**\(1\)** Passpack will automatically save all your changes as you make them. If you would like to prevent this, change the setting to **No**. Otherwise, leave it as-is.

**\(2\)** Set the number of minutes that you'd like Passpack to stay open before it locks up from inactivity. The maximum is 60 minutes. Make it much shorter if you work in a busy spot and/or often walk away from your computer. Having 1 Click Login turned on, will override this setting - your account will remain open until you turn it off. Set this to zero to stop Passpack from locking up at all. Only do this if you are absolutely, positively sure that no one will have access to your Passpack account should you walk away from the computer.

**You can manually lock up your account at any time buy pressing the Lock it up! button in the upper right corner of your screen.**

**\(3\)** This is set to Yes by default and we suggest you keep it that way. Be forewarned, that if you set this toNo, then proceed to make changes and walk away from your computer, you will risk loosing all changes because Passpack will discard them before locking up.

**\(4\)** Press **Save** to save your settings.

### How to set your password list viewing preferences?

You can set the number of rows in your password list and what you want to see for each entry in the list. To set your preferences, go into your Settings &gt; Appearance. There are a number of options available to you. The less you view, the more "airy" and clean the _Passwords_ tab will feel. The more you choose, the more cluttered it will look, but it's the trade off you get for more flexibility. Go ahead and play with these options until you find the balance that is just right for you.

![](../.gitbook/assets/appearance.jpg)

**\(1\)** Tick this option to show the _Icons_ for entry details or not. If you turn this option on, you will be able to click on any icon to quickly copy the contents without having to open the _Entry_ window.

**\(2\)** Tick this option to show the _Tags_ associated with each entry. If you turn this option on, you will be able to click on any tag to quickly filter your list. This is the same as clicking on a tag in your tag cloud.

**Keyboard trick: If you hold down the e key on your keyboard while you click a tag in your password list, you can edit the tags right then and there without opening the Entry window.**

**\(3\)** Tick this option to show a clickable _Favorites_ star for each entry entry in your list.

**\(4\)** Tick this option to show a clickable _Security Level_ lock for each entry entry in your list.

**\(5\)** Use the plus and minus button to change the number of rows. By default, this is set to 10. The minimum is 4, and the maximum is 30. Anything above 15 may cause Passpack to become sluggish.

**\(5\)** Press **Save Changes** when you're done.

### How to set your startup options?

Choose what you want Passpack to do right after you sign in to make it better fit your habits and load more quickly. To set your preferences, go into your Settings &gt; Startup Options.

![](../.gitbook/assets/startup.jpg)

**\(1\)** Choose Home to go to your Home tab after signing in. Choose Passwords to view your password list instead.

**\(2\)** If you have a large account \(with 50 entries or more\), you may start to notice that Passpack is sluggish load right after you sign in. This is because there are many password entries to unpack \(decrypt\) all at once. To make Passpack load more quickly, you can set the most used entries as Favorites, and use one of the options below for loading favorites quickly.

In addition, some people like to login to Passpack in the morning, forget about it, then use 1 Click Login all day long as they browse. To make getting going in the morning go more smoothly, choose one of the options below for turning on 1 Click Login.

1. Unpack everything This is the default option. Fine for most people, but very slow if you have many entries. 
2. Unpack everything - then turn on 1 Click Login Best for people with not too many entries, or who don't use Favorites, but DO use 1 Click Login frequently. 
3. Just unpack my favorites \(the ones with stars\) This will only load your Favorites. To load your other entries, you will need to do so manually. 
4. Just unpack my favorites - then turn on 1 Click Login for my favorites only This is similar to option \#3, however it will also automatically activate 1 Click Login for you. Only your Favorites will be available for 1 Click Login. 
5. First unpack my favorites - then unpack the rest in the background This will load your Favorites first, show them in your list, then continue to load the rest of your entries so that you don't have to do so manually. 
6. First unpack my favorites - then turn on 1 Click Login - then unpack the rest in the background This is a combination of option \#4 and \#5. Your favorites will load first, and 1 Click Login activated for them right away. Then Passpack will continue to load the rest of your entries so that you don't have to do so manually. once that is complete, ALL of your entries will available for 1 Click Login. 
7. Don't unpack anything A bit drastic, but certainly the absolute fastest. Good when you usually connect from an iPhone or PDA because it does not stress the device's low memory.

**It does not matter if you have chosen to view the Home tab or the Passwords tab upon login, all of the above options will work either way.**

**\(3\)** Click **Save Changes** when you are done.

#### How to Unpack Entries Manually

When you click on a tag, all of the entries for that tag will be unpacked, regardless of the settings above. If you choose an option which does not immediately unpack all of your entries, you may find that there are times that you need to access a certain entry which has not yet been unpacked. If you know what tag it is under, you can click that tag to gain quick access to the entry.

## Team Settings

### Where can I find my nickname for sharing?

Look in the uppermost left-hand corner of your screen when logged into your account. It should say

> Hi **YourUserID** \| _SomethingElse_

That _SomethingElse_ is the nickname you chose. If for some reason you don't see it there, go to the home tab. Next to the cube there's your User ID and underneath that is your nickname.

### How to activate secure collaboration features?

**Passpack offers password sharing, password sending and message sending features.** To use these features, you must activate Secure Collaboration \(it's not active by default\) then add people to your _People_ tab. You will need a _Nickname_ that people can recognize you by, so that you can invite each other to connect.

#### 1. Activate Collaboration

Once you are logged in, go to your Settings page and click Activate collaboration now! \(this will allow you to use sharing, messaging and password sending features\).

#### 2. Choose a Nickname

This is a name that your friends and co-workers should be able to recognize you by. Type it into the field provided and check the spelling twice because _you can not change it_.

You'll also have to answer a semi-technical question. Here's some help making that choice:

* Choose **Generate the keys server side** if you use Internet Explorer or have a slow computer. 
* Othersise, choose **Generate the keys in the browser**.  _When using this option, your browser may ask you Do you want to stop the script from running? Say NO and be patient .You only have to wait this long once during set up. Afterwards, ending messages and passwords will be instant. Otherwise, stop the process and choose Generate the keys server side instead._

**The first time you activate Secure Collaboration, you are actually telling Passpack to create a 1024bit RSA \(public and private\) key inside your browser. This is an asymmetric key algorithm which takes a while to generate. The RSA 1024 bit can result in slow Javascript processing depending on which browser you are using. Chrome and Safari can handle it with no problems, Firefox is a little bit slower, and Internet Explorer is slower than a snail on its deathbed \(that's why we give you the server side option as well\).**

#### 3. Invite Someone to Connect with You

The first time you invite a friend you will be asked to accept the Terms and Conditions. Take the time to read those few lines. It's only a one-time message.

#### How Many People Can I Connect With?

As many as you want! There's no limit. But remember: you're on Passpack, sending secure messages and passwords to and from "real life" people. There's no need to accumulate 300 friends, unless you plan on sending passwords to them all \[smile\].

#### What About Sharing? Is That the Same As Inviting Friends?

No, it's not the same.

There is a difference between simply having connected with someone listed in your **People** tab, and actively sharing with another user. _All_ accounts can connect with as many people as they want, however the number of users you can actively share with depends on the type of account you have \(Free, Pro, Group or Team\).

### Choosing a nickname for collaboration?

**Passpack offers password sharing, password sending and message sending features.** To use these features, you must activate Secure Collaboration \(it's not active by default\) then add people to your _People_ tab. You will need a _Nickname_ that people can recognize you by, so that you can invite each other to connect.

When choosing your _Nickname_ please remember:

* You will not be able to change it later;
* It's the only way friends can add you to their _People_ tab;
* It is how you will be identified in all Passpack collaboration features: messaging, sending and sharing passwords.

So check the spelling twice before pressing **Ok**.

#### Why Can't I Just Use my User ID?

If you would like to use the same thing for both your User ID and your Nickname, that's ok. Technically though, Passpack considers them two different things.

While you can change your User ID in Passpack whenever you wish, Nickname never changes. Also, the User ID can be something like 'j\*'', whereas the Nickname is limited to letters, numbers, dashes, dots and underscores so as to be easily recognizable to the people on the receiving end.
