### How to sign up for a free account?

Passpack accounts are free. Once you have signed up for an account, you will be able to access your account via the internet from any computer, and you are not required to install any software.

To get your personal Passpack account, go to the Passpack homepage and click on "[Sign Up for an Account](https://www.passpack.com/online/?showSignup=1)". Registration is fast. You will simply need to choose three pieces of information that will make up your Passpack account. That is all you'll need to know to login to Passpack from any computer.

  <span style="margin-top: 1.275em; margin-bottom: .85em; font-weight: 700; font-size: 2em;">User ID</span>
</div>

You will choose your own _User ID_. Like any other online account, this is what Passpack will know you by. some other websites call it a username, screenname, or even nickname -- these are all different words that mean the same thing. Passpack calls it a _User ID_.

Your _User ID_ must be at least 3 characters longs and it is case sensitive. So consider that as you type. Be careful not to have your CAPS lock \(or Shift lock\) on.

#### 2. Password

You will also choose your own _Password_. This is our way of saying "password" or "pass phrase". We simply use a the shortened word. This way, when reading instructions in the Passpack Help Center, you will be able to tell the difference between the passwords you store in your Passpack account \(called "passwords"\), and the one you need to login to your Passpack account \(the "Password"\).

Your _Password_ must be at least 6 characters long and is also case sensitive. You can use punctuation, numbers or even spaces. You can also watch the quality rating as you type to see how successful you are, we suggest a quality rating of at least 64 \(optional\).

#### 3. Packing Key

Last step, you will choose your secret _Packing Key_. Choosing your _Packing Key_ is easy, it's just a regular password, that Passpack uses in a special way to keep your account safe.

Your _Packing Key_ must be at least 8 characters long and is also case sensitive. You can \(and should!\) use punctuation, numbers or even spaces. We suggest a quality rating of at least 80 \(optional\).

#### Additional Options

**Email**

You can choose whether or not you want to give Passpack your email address. It's ok not to, however we highly suggest you provide your email. It is necessary in order for us to provide you with emergency support and notifications.

**Use Passpack Without Registering**

If you have an [OpenID](https://www.passpack.com/openid), a [Gmail](https://www.passpack.com/google), a [Hotmail](https://www.passpack.com/windowslive), [Yahoo](https://www.passpack.com/yahoo), [Facebook](https://www.passpack.com/facebook), [FriendFeed](https://www.passpack.com/friendfeed) or [Twitter](https://www.passpack.com/twitter) account -- then you already have a Passpack account waiting for you - no registration needed.

You simply login to Passpack with one of these accounts, then choose a Packing Key and you're done. For more information, search on either "Third Party Authentication" or the name of the service you are interested in using \(ex. Gmail\).

#### Print Yourself a Reminder

If you choose to, you can print out all three of your login credentials once you've entered your account. Store your printed login information in a VERY safe place, like a lock box. If you forget your Password, then we can reset that for you as long as you've provided an email. However, we can NOT recover or reset your Packing Key - **do not forget your Packing Key.**

### How to choose a password?

When choosing your Password, remember: long is strong. This is easy if you use a complete sentence. Here are some examples:

#### Can I have use a standard Passpack login AND a Third Party Login?

All Free and premium Passpack accounts allow ONE Passpack standard User ID and Passwordcombination, plus as many Third Party Logins as you wish.

#### Am I require to have a Passpack login, or can I just have a Third Party Login?

The standard Passpack Login is not required. However, some features do not work with Third Party Logins. For example, the [remember me feature](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200748974-How-to-Use-Remember-Me) and [_Disposable Logins_ \(also called OTPs\)](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200698865) are available on standard Passpack logins only.

#### I stored my Third Party Login in my Passpack account and forgot it. Now what?

That was a bad idea. Please contact the company that issued the password  -- Google, Windows, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, FriendFeed or your OpenID provider -- and ask them for help.

If you have this sort of problem, it may be best if you create a standard Passpack User ID and Password, and commit that to memory. This way you can store the other logins on your Passpack account without getting locked out. If you are afraid your memory will fail you in the future, we suggest you [print a copy of your Passpack login credentials](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200749034)... just in case.

#### What if I forget the password to my Third Party Login?

See previous question.

#### What Third Party Logins are the fastest?

If you remain constantly logged into your Facebook, Yahoo or OpenID account, then these will be the fastest and require less typing. The fastest option of all is actually the remember me feature for standard Passpack logins which skips the entire login screen and opens directly onto the Packing Key screen.
