# Packing Key 


# Third Party Sign Up

If you have an [OpenID](https://www.passpack.com/openid), a [Gmail](https://www.passpack.com/google), a [Hotmail](https://www.passpack.com/windowslive), [Yahoo](https://www.passpack.com/yahoo), [Facebook](https://www.passpack.com/facebook), [FriendFeed](https://www.passpack.com/friendfeed) or [Twitter](https://www.passpack.com/twitter) account -- then you already have a Passpack account waiting for you - no registration needed.

You simply login to Passpack with one of these accounts, then choose a Packing Key and you're done. For more information, search on either "Third Party Authentication" or the name of the service you are interested in using \(ex. Gmail\).

#### Print Yourself a Reminder

If you choose to, you can print out all three of your login credentials once you've entered your account. Store your printed login information in a VERY safe place, like a lock box. If you forget your Password, then we can reset that for you as long as you've provided an email. However, we can NOT recover or reset your Packing Key - **do not forget your Packing Key.**

### How to choose a password?

When choosing your Password, remember: long is strong. This is easy if you use a complete sentence. Here are some examples:

* Hi Howdy Ho
* i want my mtv
* my cat has stripes

Really, it's that easy!

You can change your User ID whenever you'd like by going to Account &gt; Change User ID from within your Passpack account. If you forget your User ID, it con only be recovered if you have set up an email for your account.

#### Can I have use a standard Passpack login AND a Third Party Login?

All Free and premium Passpack accounts allow ONE Passpack standard User ID and Passwordcombination, plus as many Third Party Logins as you wish.

#### Am I require to have a Passpack login, or can I just have a Third Party Login?

The standard Passpack Login is not required. However, some features do not work with Third Party Logins. For example, the [remember me feature](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200748974-How-to-Use-Remember-Me) and [_Disposable Logins_ \(also called OTPs\)](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200698865) are available on standard Passpack logins only.

#### I stored my Third Party Login in my Passpack account and forgot it. Now what?

That was a bad idea. Please contact the company that issued the password  -- Google, Windows, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, FriendFeed or your OpenID provider -- and ask them for help.

If you have this sort of problem, it may be best if you create a standard Passpack User ID and Password, and commit that to memory. This way you can store the other logins on your Passpack account without getting locked out. If you are afraid your memory will fail you in the future, we suggest you [print a copy of your Passpack login credentials](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200749034)... just in case.

#### What if I forget the password to my Third Party Login?

See previous question.

#### What Third Party Logins are the fastest?

If you remain constantly logged into your Facebook, Yahoo or OpenID account, then these will be the fastest and require less typing. The fastest option of all is actually the remember me feature for standard Passpack logins which skips the entire login screen and opens directly onto the Packing Key screen.
