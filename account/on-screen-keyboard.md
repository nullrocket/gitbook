To help fight against malicious keylogging software, Passpack come equipped with a virtual on-screen keyboard.
 
**To make sure the on-screen keyboard doesn't slow down the sign in process for those who aren't interested, we've loaded it into a separate library. To use the keyboards, just click the Show virtual keyboardlink anywhere on the sign in or Packing Key screen.**

Once you do that, you'll automatically see the keyboard icon ![](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200181254/virtual-keyboard-icon.png) anywhere in Passpack that requires typing your password or Packing Key. Click the icon to pull up the keyboard.
