## I forgot my password.

You can reset it here: [https://www.passpack.com/reset](https://www.passpack.com/reset)

## Basic authentication logon doesn't work.

First, remember that it won't work with your Passpack It! button. You need to click on the  icon in your password list and Passpack will log you in directly to the website. If you don't have an icon like that in your list, you need to set up the basic authentication first.

Also, you need to make sure that the site you want to log into actually uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Not all sites that use a popup window are basic authentication. If you're not sure, just contact support with the link to the site and we'll try and help you figure it out.

Lastly, if you are sure the site actually uses Basic Authentication, then you need to make sure that you are adding the correct link to your Entry window. It should not be the page on the website that actually pops up the extra popup window.

## It says my packing key is wrong, but I know it is right.

Your data is encrypted client side and only the exact sequence of characters will unlock it. Sometimes, even if you are typing it correctly, there are things that may be interfering with what is actually being input to the field:

* If you've changed computers, sometimes a different keyboard will have different language settings which generally makes a mess of things.
* The keyboard finger placement may be different between devices. \(Notebook vs. Laptop vs. Desktop\).
* The Caps-lock is ON, or Numbers-lock is OFF.
* You've tried to copy and paste from a PDF or other program instead of a text document.
* You've accidentally switched your keyboard mode in Windows by pressing ALT-SHIFT.
* You've forgotten leading or trailing spaces you input when creating your Packing Key \(if you pressed the space bar when you made it, you need to press the space bar every time you enter your Packing Key as it is part of it\).
* Your BROWSER may be having issues. Clear cache, start a new session, or close out and try a completely different browser.

Please remember: we never have your Packing Key, so it cannot be retrieved or reset by us - we do not know it. If you are still not able to access your account, use this form to see if you qualify for a Packing Key rollback \(most people do not qualify\). If not, the only option is to create a new account and start over.
