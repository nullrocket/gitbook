## Troubleshooting

#### **When I connect, I just see a logo and a blank white box, or an error message about Javascript.**

Make sure you have Javascript enabled.

#### **It tells me my User ID and Password are wrong.**

You may be mistyping one or both of them. They are case sensitive, so upper and lower case letters make a difference. For example: _Bob_, _bob_, _BOB_ and _bOb_ are considered completely different User ID's. You can recover \(and double check\) a User ID, or reset a forgotten password using this [self-service form](http://www.passpack.com/reset).

#### I don't get any error message, but when I press the Sign in button, nothing happens.

Please contact support. We'll need to know what browser version and type of computer you are using \(ex. Explorer 8 on Windows XP Home\).

#### **The self-service form tells me my account does not exist!**

Perhaps you are using Passpack Desktop? The self-service password reset form is for Passpack.com online accounts only. Also, if you have not used your account in _over six months_, it may have been considered abandoned and automatically deleted.

If none of these apply, please [contact support and tell us on _exactly_ what step you get stuck](http://help.passpack.com/knowledgebase/contact.php). We'll be happy to see if we can figure out what's wrong. A note to advanced users - browser dev build and non-stable releases are not supported.
