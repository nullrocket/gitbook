## How to sign into Passpack?

Passpack is an online application, that means that there is nothing to install \(so no icon will appear on your desktop\). To access your Passpack account, you should connect to the internet and then follow these steps:  

1. Connect to [https://www.passpack.com/online](https://www.passpack.com/online/)
2. Type in the **User ID** and **Password** that you chose when you signed up for an account.  
3. If these are correct, you will see a screen with a welcome message asking you to click on the black square. Go ahead and do that
4. You'll be prompted for the **Packing Key**. Again, you chose this at the time of signing up. Go ahead and enter it.  
5. If your Packing Key is also correct, you will see your password manager.

#### I Tried That, It's Not Working

Common issues you might run into:

**When I connect, I just see a logo and a blank white box, or an errore message about Javascirpt.**  
Make sure you have Javascript enabled.

**It tells me my User ID and Password are wrong.**  
You may be mistyping one or both of them. They are case sensitive, so upper and lower case letters make a difference. For example: _Bob_, _bob_, _BOB_ and _bOb_ are considered completly different User ID's. You can recover \(and double check\) a User ID, or reset a forgotten password using this [self-service form](http://www.passpack.com/reset).

I don't get any error message, but when I press the Sign in button, nothing happens.  
Please contact support. We'll need to know what browser version and type of computer you are using \(ex. Explorer 8 on Windows XP Home\). Please also tell us if you are trying to sign in from the [home page](http://www.passpack.com/), or the [sign in page](https://www.passpack.com/online/).

**It tells me my Packing Key is wrong.**  
[Read this article.](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200743094)

**The self-service form tells me my account does not exist!**  
Perhaps you are using Passpack Desktop? The self-service password reset form is for Passpack.com online accounts only. Also, if you have not used your account in _over six months_, it may have been considered abandoned and automatically deleted.

If none of these apply, please [contact support and tell us on _exactly_ what step you get stuck](http://help.passpack.com/knowledgebase/contact.php). We'll be happy to see if we can figure out what's wrong. A note to advanced users - browser dev build and non-stable releases are not supported. Please read here.

#### I Can't Find the Passpack Icon on My Desktop

Your Passpack.com account lives in the internet, it is not installed to your computer. That means that there will not see "Passpack" in your installed applications, or in your Windows Start menu. To access your account, you need to open our internet browser and follow the 5 steps listed at the top of this page.

#### Passpack Desktop

**There is an exception.** Passpack also offers an optional [downloadable version](http://www.passpack.com/en/passpack-desktop/) which you _can_ install on your computer. This is an additional utility that you can use to keep a personal backup copy of your online account.
