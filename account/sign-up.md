#Sign up
Passpack accounts are free. Once you have signed up for an account, you will be able to access your account via the internet from any computer.

To get your personal Passpack account, go to the Passpack homepage and click on "Sign Up for an Account". Registration is fast and only requires you to provide a few pieces of information.

* **User ID**<br>You will choose your own User ID. Like any other online account, this is what Passpack will know you by. some other websites call it a username, screenname, or even nickname -- these are all different words that mean the same thing. Passpack calls it a User ID.

  Your User ID must be at least 3 characters longs and it is case sensitive. So consider that as you type. Be careful not to have your CAPS lock (or Shift lock) on.

* **Password**<br>You will also choose your own Password. This is our way of saying "password" or "pass phrase". We simply use a the shortened word. This way, when reading instructions in the Passpack Help Center, you will be able to tell the difference between the passwords you store in your Passpack account (called "passwords"), and the one you need to login to your Passpack account (the "Password").

  Your Password must be at least 6 characters long and is also case sensitive. You can use punctuation, numbers or even spaces. You can also watch the quality rating as you type to see how successful you are, we suggest a quality rating of at least 64 (optional).
* **Packing Key**<br>
  Last step, you will choose your secret Packing Key. Choosing your Packing Key is easy, it's just a regular password, that Passpack uses in a special way to keep your account safe.

  Your Packing Key must be at least 8 characters long and is also case sensitive. You can (and should!) use punctuation, numbers or even spaces. We suggest a quality rating of at least 80 (optional).


####Additional Options

* **Email**<br>You can choose whether or not you want to give Passpack your email address. 
  It's ok not to, however we highly suggest you provide your email. It is necessary in order for us to provide you with emergency support and notifications.


####Use Passpack Without Registering

If you have an OpenID, a Gmail, a Hotmail, Yahoo, Facebook, FriendFeed or Twitter account -- then you already have a Passpack account waiting for you - no registration needed.

You simply login to Passpack with one of these accounts, then choose a Packing Key and you're done. For more information, search on either "Third Party Authentication" or the name of the service you are interested in using (ex. Gmail).
Print Yourself a Reminder

If you choose to, you can print out all three of your login credentials once you've entered your account. Store your printed login information in a VERY safe place, like a lock box. If you forget yourPassword, then we can reset that for you as long as you've provided an email. However, we can NOT recover or reset your Packing Key - do not forget your Packing Key.
