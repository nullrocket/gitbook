## Remember Me

### How to use remember me?

If you check off the Remember me for one week checkbox when signing in, Passpack will do just that. This will only work on one computer at a time, and you must first set up a _Welcome Message_. Here are the restrictions:

1. Your Welcome Message must be active.
2. You can not skip the Packing Key. You'll always have to type that in.
3. You will be remembered on 1 computer at a time.
4. You will be remembered for 1 week.
5. You must accept a cookie.

#### Why Only 1 Week?

Because otherwise, you may forget your Password. That would be unfortunate.

#### About Cookies & Security

Unlike the rest of the Passpack application, this feature uses a cookie. The cookie does not contain yourPassword, nor any variation of it, nor any personally identifying information. It contains a randomly generated, encrypted token. If the cookie is valid, then you will be able to skip the sign in screen, and go straight to your Welcome Message. If not, you will be shown the normal sign in screen.

### Passpack does not remember me, why?



Passpack will remember you for 1 week. This is to make sure that you do not forget your _Password_ in the meantime. The _Remember Me_ feature can only be activated if you have already set up your Anti-phishing Welcome Message.

#### Cookies

The _Remember Me_ feature uses a cookie. It will only work on one computer at a time. So, for example, if you tick the "Remember Me"box while signing into Passpack from your work computer, it won't recognize you on your home computer, and vice versa.  
  
Your browser must accept cookies in order for Passpack to remember you. To make sure the browser accepts them, you can follow these simple steps:  
  


> **For Internet Explorer**  
> Tools Menu -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Privacy Tab -&gt; Advanced Options -&gt; select both "Allow cookies from sites" and "Allow third party cookies"  
>   
> **For Firefox**  
> Edit Menu -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Privacy Tab -&gt; select both "Accept cookies from sites" and "Accept third party cookies." If you are using Firefox 3, you might also want to put "passpack.com" in the list of allowed exceptions.  
>   
> **For Google Chrome**  
> Go to the Tools Icon in the upper-right corner of the browser, select Options then the "Under the Hood" tab. At the bottom make sure that "Allow all cookies" is selected. Press OK and it's all done \(you may have to restart the browser\).  
>   
> **For Safari**  
> Edit Menu -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Security Tab -&gt; Select "Accept Cookies - Only from sites you navigate to"

## Anti-Phishing Welcome Message

### How to set up your anti-phishing welcome message?

Phishing is a type of internet fraud. Passpack offers protection against phishing by letting you choose a personal Welcome Message. The Welcome Message lets you be sure that you are connecting to the real Passpack, and not a copycat fraud website. If you see your Welcome Message, you are safe.

You will encounter some technical terms during this process, however once you have completed the set up the hardest part is over. From within your Passpack account, go to Settings &gt; Welcome Message.

![](../.gitbook/assets/welcomemessage.jpg)

**\(1\)** Type in the sentence you'd like Passpack to greet you with every time you sign in \(this is the fun part\). You should see the preview change as you type.

**\(2\)** Since you must set up a Welcome Message in order to use the [Remember me feature](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200748974-How-to-Use-Remember-Me), we've placed an option here to turn it on or off as well. If you logged into Passpack and forgot to check the Remember Me on the login screen, you can do that now.

**\(3\)** If you want to make signing into Passpack faster, you can choose to deactivate the intro screen. We don't suggest doing this since you will not benefit from the hand eye training.

**\(4\)** When you press the Update button, the IP address that you are currently connecting from will be automatically added to those which are allowed to see the Welcome Message. You need only choose if you want to activate Just This IP, the IP Family. or the Extended IP Family. The difference is explained below \(scroll down to the next heading\).

**\(5\)** You may also see a list of IP addresses that have already been added. You can choose to deactivate any of these if you wish. if you're not sure, leave this as.is.

**\(6\)** Press the **Update** button when you're done.

#### What do "IP" and "IP family" mean?

An IP address is the number your internet provider assigns to your internet connection. An example of an IP address could be 23.180.210.56.  
  
An IP family is a set of IP addresses, where just a  few of the last numbers change. For example both 23.180.210.37 and 23.180.210.86 are part of the same IP family because only the last two numbers are different.

An IP extended family is a set of IP addresses, where the last half of number change. For example both 23.180.210.37 and 23.180.244.86 are part of the same IP extended family.

#### Four ways an IP can change

Let's assume you have 23.180.210.37 activated as your IP address. Here are some examples:

1. When you reconnect, your new IP is 23.180.210.38.  The provider is assigning adjacent numbers.Simply pressing the Update button will add the new IP address automatically. There is no need to change any other settings.
2. When you reconnect, your new IP is 23.180.210.97.  The provider is seems to be using the entire IP family. Activating the IP family option would be useful.
3. When you reconnect, your new IP is 23.180.64.137.  The provider is seems to be using the entire IP extended family. Activating the IP extended family option would be useful.
4. When you reconnect, your new IP is 29.163.164.47.  The provider is assigning radically different IP addresses. In this case, unfortunately, you will not be able to use the Welcome Message. You might as well deactivate it \(sorry\).

#### Issues When You Travel Around

Every time you physically move to another place, then your IP address will change. This means that you will not see the Welcome Message. However, many people often connect from two or three different places on a regular basis. You can set up Passpack to recognize the IP of these places as well.  
  
To set this up, you need to physically go to each place, connect to Passpack \(you will not see yourWelcome Message so do not fear\), then enter your account as usual. Go to Security &gt; Welcome Message, scroll to the bottom of the page and press the Update button. There is no need to change any other settings. From this point on, you should be able to see your Welcome Message from this location as well.

### What should I do if I don't see my welcome message?

First, do not panic. Stop, and look and see if you are connected to [https://www.passpack.com](https://www.passpack.com/) \(be careful of artfully similar domains like passspack.com\). If the domain is correct, it's just a false alarm. You can stop reading.  
  
If the domain is NOT correct, do not type in your Packing Key. If you already have, continue following these instructions anyway. 

Open a new browser window and manually type in [https://www.passpack.com](https://www.passpack.com/). Stay calm, make sure you're not mistyping - and sign in as usual with your User ID, Password and Packing Key. Go immediately toAccount &gt; Change Password. The screen that appears will allow you to change your Password to something new and very different. Do that. Now [contact us immediately](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  
  
If you are unable to complete the steps above, you should report an account theft immediately.

#### Can There Be Any False Alarms?

Yes. If you do not see your Welcome Message, and you are sure the address is correct, then it is likely a false alarm.   
  
A common cause is if your IP address should change. This is fairly normal. If it happens frequently, you might try to select the Activate the IP family option under Settings &gt; Welcome Message.
