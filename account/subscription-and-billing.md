# Subscription and Billing

## Upgrading

To upgrade to any paid level account, go to **Account &gt; Pricing & Packages** to select a plan and make a new payment. Once you have upgraded, payments for your paid level account are due annually to maintain the same. Your credit card will _not_ be charged automatically. When the time grows near to renew your account, Passpack will begin sending you reminder emails. Follow the instructions in the email, or go to **Account &gt; Pricing & Packages** to make a new payment.

## Payment Methods

We accept all major credit cards via Paypal.  Paypal may allow you to use a credit card in some instances without a Paypal account, this is at their discretion. Some of the reasons the option may not be available are listed below.

* You have used the credit card optional feature to pay several times \(Paypal may require that you create an account\)
* The country your customers reside in.   Not all countries have all PayPal features available. 
* The IP address of your hosted site is on a blocked list. 

## Invoices

A few days after your payment, an invoice will be posted to your account. This generally takes between 2-3 business days. To see or download your invoices, go to **Account &gt; Invoices** from within your Passpack account.

## Promocodes

Congratulations! People with a _promocode_ have usually won a contest, or have done something extraordinary. Usually a promocode entitles you to a discount, an upgrade or additional services on your Passpack account. Each promocode is unique and can be used only once.

#### How to Use Your Promocode

If you don't have a Passpack account yet, sign up for a free account before continuing. From inside your Passpack account, go to **Account &gt; Packages & Pricing** link in the upper-right hand corner of your screen. The pricing table will appear.

If you have a promocode for a Free+ account, or for additional services on your Free account, click the link **Have a Free+ promocode?** in the _Free_ column. Enter your promocode in the filed that appears and press the OK button.

If you have a discount or free upgrade on a paid account, enter your promocode in the field in the appropriate column then press the red **Buy Now** button. If there is no payment due, you do not have to provide any payment information.

That's it, you're account should be immediately updated.

#### Frequently Asked Promocode Questions

#### Where Can I Get a Promocode?

Promocodes are usually won in a contest, or received as a gift or bonus. If you are a blogger or are running a giveaway, please contact [press@passpack.com](mailto:press@passpack.com) for information on promocodes.

#### Can I Give My Promocode To a Friend?

Yes you can. Promocodes are not assigned to any particular person, however please remember that they can only be used once. If you give your promocode to your friend, you will not be able to use it for yourself.

#### Is there a free trial on paid plans?

There's no need. Go ahead and sign up for a Free account. You may use it for as long as like \(even forever\), then upgrade to a paid account when you're ready. We're not rushing you.

You do not need a credit card to sign up for a free account, you may provide that when you are ready to purchase.

If you do decide to upgrade, you have an additional 30 days after payment to request a 100% refund if your not completely satisfied.

## Payment Grace Period

That's Ok. Passpack has a built in grace period to make sure that no one accidentally looses their data because they missed a payment by a few days. Try signing into your account and you should be prompted to renew. If you are not ale to sign into your account, [contact us](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we'll see if we can help you out.

You should receive email notifications when it's time to renew your account. If you aren't receiving these emails, once you are back into your account, check to make sure that you have set up and confirmed an email address.

## Refunds

**Passpack has a 30-day money back guarantee, so you can try the plan you want to risk free!**

If you are not completely satisfied with the paid plan you have purchased, please request a full refund within 30 days of your purchase. To request a refund, please [complete and submit this form](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

\*Requests made after 30 days will not be approved. We are sorry, but there are no partial or prorated refunds after the 30 day period.

#### Your Account will be Downgraded to "Free". What that Means...

If you request a refund and one is processed, your account will be downgraded to a Free account. Please remember that Free level plans only store up to 100 password entries. Please be sure you have exported any important data from your Passpack account before requesting a refund to prevent data retention issues.

You may continue to use the Free downgraded account for as long as you'd like, or if you wish, you may delete it.
