## How to print your login credentials?

If you are afraid you might forget your Passpack login information, you can print out a copy for the future. You can keep it in a safety deposit box so that it's secure \(so you won't need it everyday\) - but in an emergency, you'll have it.

To make a printout of your _User ID, Password and Packing Key_, enter your Passpack account. Click on your **Account** link \(on the right, between Tools and Help\). On the bottom of the left-hand column click the**print your Passpack login information link**. You will be asked to insert your Packing Key to confirm that you are sure. Click Continue.

When you have finished printing, press the **Back** button and you will return to your Passpack account.






## How to set your packing and saving preferences?

You can decide how long your Passpack account stays inactive before it locks up. You can also set it to automatically save any changes you've made in the meantime. To set your preferences, go into your Settings &gt; Packing and Saving.

**\(1\)** Passpack will automatically save all your changes as you make them. If you would like to prevent this, change the setting to **No**. Otherwise, leave it as-is.

**\(2\)** Set the number of minutes that you'd like Passpack to stay open before it locks up from inactivity. The maximum is 60 minutes. Make it much shorter if you work in a busy spot and/or often walk away from your computer. Having 1 Click Login turned on, will override this setting - your account will remain open until you turn it off. Set this to zero to stop Passpack from locking up at all. Only do this if you are absolutely, positively sure that no one will have access to your Passpack account should you walk away from the computer.

**You can manually lock up your account at any time buy pressing the Lock it up! button in the upper right corner of your screen.**

**\(3\)** This is set to Yes by default and we suggest you keep it that way. Be forewarned, that if you set this toNo, then proceed to make changes and walk away from your computer, you will risk loosing all changes because Passpack will discard them before locking up.

**\(4\)** Press **Save** to save your settings.

## How to set your password list viewing preferences?

You can set the number of rows in your password list and what you want to see for each entry in the list. To set your preferences, go into your Settings &gt; Appearance. There are a number of options available to you. The less you view, the more "airy" and clean the _Passwords_ tab will feel. The more you choose, the more cluttered it will look, but it's the trade off you get for more flexibility. Go ahead and play with these options until you find the balance that is just right for you.

**\(1\)** Tick this option to show the _Icons_ for entry details or not. If you turn this option on, you will be able to click on any icon to quickly copy the contents without having to open the _Entry_ window.

**\(2\)** Tick this option to show the _Tags_ associated with each entry. If you turn this option on, you will be able to click on any tag to quickly filter your list. This is the same as clicking on a tag in your tag cloud.

**Keyboard trick: If you hold down the e key on your keyboard while you click a tag in your password list, you can edit the tags right then and there without opening the Entry window.**

**\(3\)** Tick this option to show a clickable _Favorites_ star for each entry entry in your list.

**\(4\)** Tick this option to show a clickable _Security Level_ lock for each entry entry in your list.

**\(5\)** Use the plus and minus button to change the number of rows. By default, this is set to 10. The minimum is 4, and the maximum is 30. Anything above 15 may cause Passpack to become sluggish.

**\(5\)** Press **Save Changes** when you're done.



### How to Unpack Entries Manually

When you click on a tag, all of the entries for that tag will be unpacked, regardless of the settings above. If you choose an option which does not immediately unpack all of your entries, you may find that there are times that you need to access a certain entry which has not yet been unpacked. If you know what tag it is under, you can click that tag to gain quick access to the entry.
