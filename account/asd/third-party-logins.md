### How to add a third party login?

Additional Third Party Logins can be added ONLY if you have also a standard Passpack User ID and Password combination. If you do not have these, you can set them up under Account &gt; Set a User ID and Account &gt; Set a Password.

To manage your Third Party Logins, go to Account &gt; Associate Another Login from within your Passpack account. Click the Start Now button and then choose which kind of login you'd like to associate with the account.

### How to delete a third party login?

Third Party Logins can be deleted ONLY if you also have a standard Passpack User ID and Password combination. If you do not have these, you can set them up under Account &gt; Set a User ID and Settings &gt; Set a Password.

To manage your Third Party Logins, go to Account &gt; Associate Another Login from within your Passpack account. Scroll down to the see the list of Third Party Logins that have been previously associated. To the right of each login, you should see an X. Click the X to remove Third Party Login.
