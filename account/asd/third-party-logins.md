## Third Party Login for Existing Accounts

If you already have a Passpack account, then you have probably already chosen a Passpack User ID and Password. However you can still associate a Third Party Login to your account. You can associate as many Third Party Logins with your account as you like.

### How to add a third party login?

Additional Third Party Logins can be added ONLY if you have also a standard Passpack User ID and Password combination. If you do not have these, you can set them up under Account &gt; Set a User ID and Account &gt; Set a Password.

To manage your Third Party Logins, go to Account &gt; Associate Another Login from within your Passpack account. Click the Start Now button and then choose which kind of login you'd like to associate with the account.

### How to delete a third party login?

Third Party Logins can be deleted ONLY if you also have a standard Passpack User ID and Password combination. If you do not have these, you can set them up under Account &gt; Set a User ID and Settings &gt; Set a Password.

To manage your Third Party Logins, go to Account &gt; Associate Another Login from within your Passpack account. Scroll down to the see the list of Third Party Logins that have been previously associated. To the right of each login, you should see an X. Click the X to remove Third Party Login.

This will not delete your Passpack account. It will simply tell Passpack, for example, "I no longer want to use my Facebook account to sign into Passpack."

## Signing Up with Third Party Credentials

Passpack allows you to use an existing login from one of the supported providers as the login for your Passpack account.

#### How to Sign Up

To use your Third Party Credentials, go to [https://www.passpack.com/online](https://www.passpack.com/online) and click on the provider's icon on the left, then follow the instructions that will appear in the Sign In dialog to the right.



#### Am I require to have a Passpack login, or can I just have a Third Party Login?

The standard Passpack Login is not required. However, some features do not work with Third Party Logins. For example, the [remember me feature](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200748974-How-to-Use-Remember-Me) and [_Disposable Logins_ \(also called OTPs\)](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200698865) are available on standard Passpack logins only.

#### I stored my Third Party Login in my Passpack account and forgot it. Now what?

That was a bad idea. Please contact the company that issued the password  -- Google, Windows, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, FriendFeed or your OpenID provider -- and ask them for help.

If you have this sort of problem, it may be best if you create a standard Passpack User ID and Password, and commit that to memory. This way you can store the other logins on your Passpack account without getting locked out. If you are afraid your memory will fail you in the future, we suggest you [print a copy of your Passpack login credentials](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200749034)... just in case.

#### What if I forget the password to my Third Party Login?

See previous question.

#### What Third Party Logins are the fastest?

If you remain constantly logged into your Facebook, Yahoo or OpenID account, then these will be the fastest and require less typing. The fastest option of all is actually the remember me feature for standard Passpack logins which skips the entire login screen and opens directly onto the Packing Key screen.
