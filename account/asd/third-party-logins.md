#### I stored my Third Party Login in my Passpack account and forgot it. Now what?

That was a bad idea. Please contact the company that issued the password  -- Google, Windows, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, FriendFeed or your OpenID provider -- and ask them for help.

If you have this sort of problem, it may be best if you create a standard Passpack User ID and Password, and commit that to memory.

If you remain constantly logged into your Facebook, Yahoo or OpenID account, then these will be the fastest and require less typing.
