## **How to Clean Your Pack**

Passpack has a little utility that will optimize your account by locating any emails placed in the User ID field of your entries, and moving them to the proper Email field instead. The tool also cleans up duplicate tags and any invisible programming artifacts.

From within your Passpack account, go to **Tools &gt; Clean** your pack and press the **Clean Now** button.You may need to return to your Passwords tab and press the **Save All** button if any changes were made.
