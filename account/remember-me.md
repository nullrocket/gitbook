## Remember Me

### How to use remember me?

If you check off the Remember me for one week checkbox when signing in, Passpack will do just that. This will only work on one computer at a time, and you must first set up a _Welcome Message_. Here are the restrictions:

1. Your Welcome Message must be active.
2. You can not skip the Packing Key. You'll always have to type that in.
3. You will be remembered on 1 computer at a time.
4. You will be remembered for 1 week.
5. You must accept a cookie.

#### Why Only 1 Week?

Because otherwise, you may forget your Password. That would be unfortunate.

#### About Cookies & Security

Unlike the rest of the Passpack application, this feature uses a cookie. The cookie does not contain yourPassword, nor any variation of it, nor any personally identifying information. It contains a randomly generated, encrypted token. If the cookie is valid, then you will be able to skip the sign in screen, and go straight to your Welcome Message. If not, you will be shown the normal sign in screen.

### Passpack does not remember me, why?



Passpack will remember you for 1 week. This is to make sure that you do not forget your _Password_ in the meantime. The _Remember Me_ feature can only be activated if you have already set up your Anti-phishing Welcome Message.

#### Cookies

The _Remember Me_ feature uses a cookie. It will only work on one computer at a time. So, for example, if you tick the "Remember Me"box while signing into Passpack from your work computer, it won't recognize you on your home computer, and vice versa.
Your browser must accept cookies in order for Passpack to remember you. To make sure the browser accepts them, you can follow these simple steps:


> **For Internet Explorer**
> Tools Menu -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Privacy Tab -&gt; Advanced Options -&gt; select both "Allow cookies from sites" and "Allow third party cookies"
>
> **For Firefox**
> Edit Menu -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Privacy Tab -&gt; select both "Accept cookies from sites" and "Accept third party cookies." If you are using Firefox 3, you might also want to put "passpack.com" in the list of allowed exceptions.
>
> **For Google Chrome**
> Go to the Tools Icon in the upper-right corner of the browser, select Options then the "Under the Hood" tab. At the bottom make sure that "Allow all cookies" is selected. Press OK and it's all done \(you may have to restart the browser\).
>
> **For Safari**
> Edit Menu -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Security Tab -&gt; Select "Accept Cookies - Only from sites you navigate to"
