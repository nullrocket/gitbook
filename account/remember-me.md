# Remember Me

## How to use remember me

Check the Remember me for one week checkbox when signing in. This will only work on one computer at a time, and you must first set up a [**Welcome Message**](/account/welcome-message.md). 

In order for the remember me feature to work

* Your Welcome Message must be active.
* You will be remembered on 1 computer at a time.
* You will be remembered for 1 week.
* You must accept a cookie.

#### Why Only 1 Week?

Because otherwise, you may forget your Password. That would be unfortunate.

#### About Cookies & Security

Unlike the rest of the Passpack application, this feature uses a cookie. The cookie does not contain your password, nor any variation of it, nor any personally identifying information. It contains a randomly generated, encrypted token. If the cookie is valid, then you will be able to skip the sign in screen, and go straight to your Welcome Message. If not, you will be shown the normal sign in screen.
