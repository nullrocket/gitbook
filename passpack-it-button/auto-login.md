Auto-login simply means that you use your Passpack It! button to have Passpack fill in the login form for you to any of the websites that you have stored in your Passpack account. You must connect to the website's login form via the **Go** button in your main password list, or on **Go There** from the entry window.

## **How to Auto-Login With Basic Authentication**

_Basic Authentication_ is a special \(older\) type of login where the website does not have a login form directly on the webpage. Instead the browser opens a grayish looking box requesting username and password. The_Passpack It!_ button is not able to log you into these websites because of the popup, however there is workaround method that you can use.

**\(1\)** In your [Entry window](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200814020-The-Password-Entry-Window), click on the small **Options** tab to your right.

**\(2\)** Select **Yes** under the _Site requires Basic Authentication?_ option.

**\(3\)** Press **OK** to save your changes.

You should now see a slightly different icon in your password list for this entry. From this point on, to auto-login to that website, you will need to click through to the website from inside your Passpack account by clicking on this icon.

**Tech info: usually when you auto-login to a website, we make it so that the website doesn't know your connecting via Passpack. This is an extra precaution so that a unethical webmaster doesn't try and use this information to mount a personal attack on you. It's pretty improbable, but we prefer being safe to sorry. When using Basic Authentication, Passpack can not perform this "cleaning" service for you, so please be careful to make sure that you are connecting to reputable sites, they will know you are arriving to them from Passpack.**

## **Auto-login: When to Ask for Help**

As you know, you can, and should, teach Passpack how to login to new websites with your Passpack It! button. This should work pretty often, but there are some times when it's better to ask for help. Here are some examples.

### Tips to Make it Work

Before you read on to the solutions to common problems, make sure have [read this article](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200736584) on how to teach Passpack a website. And remember go slowly.

### When You Need More Fields

Some websites use a captcha, require you to check boxes, or request that you fill out more fields than just the username and password. The solution is very simple: fill out the extra fields, check boxes and captchas, BEFORE pressing your Passpack It! button. Easy as that.

### When it Used to Work

Sometimes, you'll just swear that you've already used your _Passpack It!_ button on a website, but when you come back to it, it asks you to teach it. No worries, chances are, you're not going crazy. Websites change from time to time, and Passpack needs to be retrained. You can use [this form](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) or the **Feedback** tab in your Passpack It! pop-up to quickly let us know. We'll usually solve the problem fairly quickly.

### When it Just Refuses to Work

This can be frustrating, but there are some very tricky things that may cause the Passpack It! button to get confused. Here are some:

1. the login is on a different domain \(ex. Flickr login on Yahoo\)
2. the site uses multiple page login \(ex. egg.com\)
3. the site uses HTTP Basic Authentication
4. the login is in a Flash movie or Java Applet
5. the site itself has errors

In case \#1, we can help so you can [use this form](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to request an alias. For all the others, sorry but your auto-login will not work. Passpack might \(big maybe\) support \#2 or \#3 in the future, but it will never support \#4 or \#5.

## **How to Auto-login When There Are Three Fields**

Your _Passpack It!_ button can only autofill two fields for you. If you come across a login form with three fields \(for example, _Company_, _User ID_ and _Password_\), then try one of these two options.

**1. Autofill + Paste**

Manually type or paste in one of the fields, then you can train Passpack to auto-fill the other two for you. Keep in mind this will only work when all three fields are present on the same page.

**2. Copy/Paste all Three**

Double click on your _Passpack It!_ button. In the window that pops up, click on the copy/paste tab. If you've stored the _Company_ name in the notes section of your entry, then you can simply copy and paste all the info directly into the login form.



### I Don't Want to Keep Passpack Open. Is There An Option for That?

Yes, there is. Go to **Auto-login &gt; Options for power users**. Please make sure you understand [how this works, and the implications](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200254369).
