# Regeneration

If something is not working right with your PAsspack It! button, the first step is to regenerate it to eliminate any possibility of file corruption. 

Go to the Auto-login tab inside your account, click on Install your button and then click on Regenerate Now.

You must the delete your existing button, and install the new (regenerated) one.
