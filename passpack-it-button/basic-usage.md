## Basic Usage

Normally, in order for your _Passpack It!_ button to work, your Passpack account must be open in a browser window or tab. If it isn't you may see the following message when you click your Passpack It! button:

To use the Passpack It! button, you must connect to this website through your Passpack Password Manager.

To avoid this message, make sure that you have Passpack open in a browser window or tab and are able to see a list of passwords in the Passwords tab in your Passpack account.  Remember that Passpack may [automatically lockup](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200749054) when left unattended, or if you press the Lock it up! button. If Passpack is asking you for your _Packing Key_, then your account has timed out. You will need to insert your _Packing Key_ in order for your _Passpack It!_ button to work.

## Teaching Passpack to Login to New Websites

Your _Passpack It!_ button can only log you into websites that it's learned already. Teaching a new website is optional, but it's also fairly easy. Here's how to do it.

First, make sure that you have [installed your _Passpack It!_ button](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200827350), and you know [how to use it](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200736584).

When Passpack needs you to teach it a new website, you will see pop-up box with instructions. These instructions should be fairly straight forward - read them, press **Start Training Now** to make the pop-up box go away. Now, click on the username field, the password field and the login button \(in that order\). A dotted red border lets you know your click has been recorded.

{% hint style='tip' %}
**Click slowly.** Give Passpack some time between clicks to register what is happening. Wait for the red border to appear. Usually a deep breath between clicks will work  and you'll be more relaxed too \[smile\]. If there is no red border after a deep breath, then try clicking it again \(just once, don't go wild\).
{% endhint %}

Once you do this, you'll see an alert box that will ask you if you think it worked or not:

> **If so**, press OK, the page will refresh and you can press your Passpack It! button again to login. It should work right away.
>
> **If not**, or you're not sure, just press cancel and no harm done \(scroll down for instructions when it seems to be broken\).

{% hint style='tip' %}
**Use the Escape Key.** If, when you click the field, the browser shows you a bunch of autofill options like this:

 ![](/assets/autologin_trainingESC.gif)

then just press the **ESC** key on your keyboard and it'll go away. This won't interfere with training and you can proceed.


{% endhint %}


### When Training Does Not Work

The internet is a varied an complex place. The Passpack It! button does its absolute best to learn new websites, but it can't always manage. If you have repeatedly tried to teach it a new site but just can't get it to work, then it's best that you [tell us here](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with a link to the site that is not working.

**NEW** For even faster service, double click on your _Passpack It!_ button. this will bring up a pop-up box. Click on the Feedback tab, and use the form to immediately submit the website to our attention.

_There is no need to send any login information - so please don't._

## **How to Report Broken Websites**

Did you know you can **double click your** _**Passpack It!**_ **button**? Yes you can! It's the fastest way to report a broken website link to us. Just double click your button and a small popup window will appear. Go to the**Feedback** section, and let us know what's wrong.

![](.gitbook/assets/passpackit-feedback.jpg)

The broken website link will be automatically queued in our system. We go through these link manually, and fix them one by one. Once a link hat you've reported has been fixed, you'll receive a short automated email to let you know. If, for some reason it's still not working for you, then just reply to that email and you'll get personalized one-on-one support.

### How Long Does it Take to Get Fixed?

That depends. Some sites require just a quick fix on our part and can generally get done in a couple of days. Others may be much more complex, must be escalated directly to the development team, and will take longer depending on their work load.

**Should there be a backlog, we try and give priority to links submitted by our premium users.**

### What If I Don't Get an Email?

If you do not receive an email, then you may not have set one up and confirmed it in your account. [Here's how to do that](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200698505-How-to-Confirm-and-Manage-Your-Email).

Also, if the link is beyond repair, we'll just mark it off as such and won't bother you with an email. You'll still be able to login to that website, but you may need to copy/paste the password from the \_Passpack It!\_popup, into the login form manually.

### It Seems Like ALL Sites are Broken...

If it feels like "it just doesn't work" then you'll be best served by contacting us for personal support. Thousands of users login to thousands websites every day with their _Passpack It!_ buttons. If all the sites broke at once... we'd know \[grin\]. Chances are there's something that isn't set up just quite right. Check these things first:

1. [The button is correctly installed](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200827350).
2. [That you are using it correctly](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200736584).
3. You have left Passpack open in the background while you use your button \([how to get around this](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200254369)\).

Still not working? [No worries, let us know what's not working, and we'll help you out](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

## **Auto-login, 1 Click Login and Passpack It! -- Help?**

### What is the difference between Auto-login and 1 Click Login?

With Auto-login  
You can log into a site from within your account. For example, you want to check my mail, you press the Go There button next to the entry for my Yahoo account, a new tab opens in my browser, you press thePasspack It! button and you're in.

With 1 Click Login turned on  
You can log into a site without going through your account each time. For example, you are surfing the Internet normally, you come across an article on Yahoo, you decide you want to check your email while you're there, you click on the "Sign In" link on the page, press your Passpack It! button and you're in. For this to work you have to have your Passpack account open in another tab or window of my browser, and [1 Click Login turned on](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200254359).

### Why has my Passpack It! Button stopped working? How can I fix this?

This could happen for a series of reasons: an update on our side, a bug, a browser update, etc. The fastest way to fix this is to regenerate your button. To do this, go to the Auto-login tab within your account. Click on Install your button, at the bottom of the page you will see Security Tip: Regenerate Your Buttons. As the warning says, this will cause every button you have ever installed to stop working permanently.

### Why does a particular site not work when I try to use Auto-login?

Some sites need training in order to work properly, you can [train them yourself](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200736584) when the instructions appear.

### When I try to use Auto-login to access a site, it says I have to connect through Passpack. What does it mean?

For Google Chrome  
Go to the Tools Icon in the upper-right corner of the browser, select Options then the "Under the Hood" tab. At the bottom make sure that "Allow all cookies" is selected. Press OK and it's all done \(you may have to restart the browser\).

### Certain websites use one page to enter your username, and one webpage to enter your password. Is this a supported type of login?

No, sorry.

## **How to Auto-login When There Are Three Fields**

Your _Passpack It!_ button can only autofill two fields for you. If you come across a login form with three fields \(for example, _Company_, _User ID_ and _Password_\), then try one of these two options.

**1. Autofill + Paste**

Manually type or paste in one of the fields, then you can train Passpack to auto-fill the other two for you. Keep in mind this will only work when all three fields are present on the same page.

**2. Copy/Paste all Three**

Double click on your _Passpack It!_ button. In the window that pops up, click on the copy/paste tab. If you've stored the _Company_ name in the notes section of your entry, then you can simply copy and paste all the info directly into the login form.

## **Passpack It! says I have to connect through Passpack, but I did.**

If Passpack tells you **To use the Passpack It! button, you must connect to this website through your Passpack Password Manager** that almost always means your browser does not accept cookies.

The Passpack It! button can only work if your browser accepts cookies. Follow these steps:

**For Internet Explorer**  
Tools Menu -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Privacy Tab -&gt; Advanced Options -&gt; select both "Allow cookies from sites" and "Allow third party cookies"

**For Google Chrome**  
Go to the Tools Icon in the upper-right corner of the browser, select Options then the "Under the Hood" tab. At the bottom make sure that "Allow all cookies" is selected. Press OK and it's all done \(you may have to restart the browser\).
