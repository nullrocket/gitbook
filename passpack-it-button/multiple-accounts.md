## **Same Domain, Multiple Logins with 1 Click Login**

Passpack's 1 Click Login can handle multiple logins on the same website. Press your \_Passpack It!\_button as you normally would and if there is more than one entry that you need to choose from, you'll see a popup like the one below.

Click the entry you're interested in and Passpack will log you in.

Done!

_\(oh and if you change your mind, just press ESC and the popup will go away just like with any other Passpack popup\)_
