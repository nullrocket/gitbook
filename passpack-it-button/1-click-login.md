1 Click login is a faster way of using your **Passpack It!** button. With 1 Click Login, you can leave Passpack open in a tab or window while you browse, then simply click your Passpack It! button when you happen upon a website that you would like to login to.

This is different from standard auto-login because you do not need to connect to the website's login form via your Passpack account.

## Enable/Disable 1-Click Login

To get your _Passpack It!_ button to use 1 Click Login, you must first turn it on from within your account. Then you can browse the internet in a different window \(or tab\) for as long as you like. When you want to login to a website, just click your _Passpack It!_ button.

### How to Turn On 1 Click Login

You can do this one of two ways: either by clicking the button in the upper right hand corner of the pane that says Turn On 1 Click Login or going to the Auto-login tab and click Turn it On.

You can set 1-Click Login to be on by default by setting it in your [startup options](/account/settings/startup-options.md).

### How To Turn Off 1 Click Login

There are five ways to turn off 1 Click Login:

1. Click turn it off in the top-right corner of your screen
2. Go to **1 Click Login** in your **Auto-login** tab, press Stop.
3. Click Lock it up! in the upper right corner of your screen.
4. From any website, double-click your Passpack It! button. Click **turn it off** in the bottom-right corner of the pop-up.
5. Logout or close your browser.

{% hint style='tip' %}
After you have turned off 1 Click Login, you may still use your Passpack It! button, but you must click through to websites from your password list.
{% endhint %}

## **Keeping 1 Click Login On Even If You Lock Up or Close Your Tab**

By default, Passpack will not lock up your account when 1 Click Login is active.

This means that your account must always be open \(and visible\) in order to use your _Passpack It!_ button. However, some folks like to login to Passpack in the morning, and want to use 1 Click Login all day without having to keep Passpack open and unlocked in a tab. Go to **Auto-login &gt; Options for power users** to do this.

> Please note that if you close the _entire browser_, 1 Click Login will be shut off. This option applies to closing a single tab, not the whole browser.

In this case, the _Passpack It!_ button will remain active as long as you use it at least once every X hours \(you choose how many hours\). Be careful - this is not X hours from the time you last entered your Passpack account, it's X hours since the last time you pressed your _Passpack It!_ button.

### An Example of How it Works

Suppose you set this option to 4 hours. On Monday 8am, you login to your Passpack account and activate 1 Click Login. Then you lock up our account - you have 4 hours to use your Passpack It! button before it deactivates. Great. Let's say you use it at 11am. You now have another 4 hours \(until 3pm\) to use it before it deactivates.

Now it's lunchtime \(hooray!\). You _should_ turn off 1 Click Login at this point. If you forget to do so AND you do not close your browser, it'll remain active for the entire time you are gone. Anyone could walk up to your computer and start logging into websites with your credentials. Please be careful when activating this option.

A note to people with nosy significant others or family members. You too, should be weary of activating this option.

**Please understand the potential Pros & Cons to this approach before you use it. Be responsible.**
