# **How to Install the Passpack It! Button**

Once you're signed into Passpack, just choose Auto-Login &gt; Install Your Button. Right click on the_Passpack It!_ button and add it to your bookmarks. A button that says "Passpack It!" should then appear in your bookmarks. Below are detailed instructions for each type of internet browser.

Didn't work? See instructions below for each type of browser.

## Internet Explorer 9

The first step to gain access and display the bookmark tool is to let Internet Explorer 9 show it. In fact, all toolbars are hidden by default.

* Open Internet Explorer 9.
* Right click the tabbed area. At this point a small menu will appear. Such a menu is quite important \(and well hidden,too!\) because it will shows you how to display the bookmark toolbar and other options.
* Untick the Lock Toolbars option.
* Click the Favorites Bar.

At this point, once you have “unleashed” all the bookmarks, simply drag the Passpack It! button on the bookmark toolbar and drop it.

## Internet Explorer 8

You'll need to make sure your Internet Explorer 8 Favorites bar is enabled and visible. Here's how:

1. _Enable:_ from your browser's menu, go to **Tools &gt; Toolbars** and make sure Favorites bar is checked**.**
2. _View:_ from your browser's menu, go to **View &gt; Toolbar &gt; Favorites bar**
3. _Install:_
   * Right-click on the Passpack It! button and choose **Add to Favorites**. 
   * A security alert dialog will appear, click **Yes**. 
   * The _Add a Favorite_ dialog opens. Click the **Create In** combo box and choose **Favorites bar**.
   * Then click **Add** to add the bookmarklet to your Favorites bar.

## Internet Explorer 7

To install the button, right click the _Passpack It!_ link and choose **Add to favorites** from the menu. A small popup will appear, choose to save it to the "Links" option then press **OK**. You may get a security warning, just press OK. It's safe.

You should see it show up in your browser bar right away. If this isn't the case, you may not have your links bar showing. From your browsers menu, choose **View &gt; Toolbar &gt; Links**. That should do it.

## Internet Explorer 6

To install the button, right click the _Passpack It!_ link and choose **Add to favorites** from the menu. A small popup will appear, press OK. Then open your favorites and drag _Passpack it!_ into the "Links" folder.

## Chrome

Make sure you actually have the bookmarks bar showing, or you won't have a place to drag the button _onto_. Open a new tab. Right click the bookmarks bar near the top of the page and choose **Always show the bookmarks bar**.

## All Other Browsers

To install the button, simply drag the _Passpack It!_ link to your **Personal Toolbar**.

## If It _Still_ Didn't Show Up

If you followed the instructions, you should see the button show up in your browser bar right away. If this isn't the case, you may not have your Personal Toolbar showing. That's easy enough to fix.
