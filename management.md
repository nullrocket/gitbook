## Create/Edit/Delete

### The password entry window.

The Entry Window is the form you fill out in order to add or modify the passwords saved in your Passpack account. It is built mostly for storing passwords, but can also allow you to control a lot of information. 

You can fill out as much, or as little information as you'd like. You are only required to fill out at least the Title and at least one other field. It doesn't matter what that field is, it can be a Password, a Note, or just a Link. The choice is yours.

**Title \(required\) - First, give each entry a name, like "Work Gmail Account".  This will be what you see in the Password tab where all your entries are listed.**

**User ID** - Enter your User ID, Username, Screen-name or Nickname needed to log into the website. Be sure to be case specific. If the website uses your email instead of a username, then enter that in the Email field instead.

**For your Passpack It! button to work for a website, you must provide either a User ID or an Email.**

**Email** - Sometimes websites ask you for an email, as well as standard login information. If you'd like to remember which email you've used, you can make note of it in the email field. Other websites use the email in lieu of a User ID. In this case, you can put the email either in the User ID field, or in the email field. Your **Passpack It!** button will work either way. It's a matter of personal choice.

**Password** - You can enter the password for the website in the password field. If you need to create a password, press the Generate button, and allow the password generator to give you a super strong password. To protect your password from spying eyes, it may be hidden \(or scrambled\). To view the password, simply press the show button. To hide it again, press hide. You can not change the password while it is hidden.

**For your Passpack It! button to work for a website, you must provide a Password.**

**Link** - Use the Link field to paste in the URL \(website address\) where you log into the website. For example: http://www.gmail.com/login. Once entered, you can just click on Go There and you'll be taken to directly to the website.

**For your Passpack It! button to work for a website, you must provide a Link.** 

**Tags** - Tags are one way that you can choose to search through and filter your password entries. You can enter as many as you like, and make them whatever you like.  Those tags will appear in the entry, and in the Password pane under the tag list. For instance, you might tag this entry with "work", "Gmail", "email", and "google".   

You don't have to use tags if you choose not to, they're not required.

**Notes** - The Notes field gives you a place to store some additional information. For instance, if you've been asked security questions in the account setup, you can store your responses here, which gives you the opportunity to use false answers to your security questions, making the account less likely to be exposed to fraud.

Like the Password field, the Notes field may be hidden \(or scrambled\) to protect your notes from spying eyes. To view your notes, simply press the **Show** button. To hide it again, press **Hide**. You cannot modify your notes while they are hidden.

#### Apply Changes to Your Entry

When you are done, press the **OK** button. The entry will be colored **red** in your password list. New entries will also be marked as NEW.  Press the red **Save All** button to permanently save all of your changes to the Passpack server. 

If you need to make many changes, you may wait until you have finished before pressing the **Save All** button. However you MUST press the Save All button before attempting to logout of Passpack, close your browser, or shut down your computer.

#### Cancel Changes to Your Entry

If you have changed your mind and do not want to proceed, press the **Cancel** button. The **Entry Window** will close. New entries will not be added, and no changes will be made to existing entries.

If you accidentally pressed **OK** instead of **Cancel**, it's okay, you can still undo the changes by clicking the **arrow** to the left of the **Go** button. This will undo all changes made to an existing entry, or will remove a new entry. Once you press the **Save All** button, you will no longer be able to undo.

#### "Delete" and "Send to" Options

The **Delete** link lets you delete the entry.

The **Send to** link lets you send a copy of the entry to someone you trust.

### How to add or change a password entry?

**To completely remove an entry from your Passpack account, go to your password list in your Passwords tab, locate the password entry that you would like to delete and hover over it with your mouse. You will see a trash can appear on the far right of the row. Click the trash can to delete your entry.**

_Keyboard shortcut: to go even more quickly, you can hold down the d key on your keyboard while clicking an entry to delete it._  

#### How to Delete a Multiple Entries at Once 

If you have multiple of entries to delete at once, you can use the Bulk Editing feature to do so quickly.

#### If You Have Turned Off Auto-Saving

**Save the Changes to Your Password List**

To permanently save your changes, press the red **Save All** button. If you'd like to delete more entries, or would like to make other changes, you may wait until you have finished before pressing the **Save All** button. However you MUST press the **Save All** button before attempting to logout of Passpack, close your browser or shut down your computer.

**Restore a Deleted Entry to Your Password List**

If you accidentally delete an entry and _have not yet pressed the Save All button_, you can still undo an entry deletion. Locate the red **Unsaved Changes** link in your _Quick Filters_ pane to the left of your password list. This will list all the entries in your password list which have changed but have not yet been saved. Locate the entry you would like to undelete and click the arrow all the way to the left. This will place the entry back into your password list.

## Import

### How to export from Roboform, import into Passpack?

Unfortunately, Roboform does not have an export feature. Luckily, they DO offer Save as HTML as an alternative. Here's how to import your Roboform passwords and notes into Passpack.

Roboform saves your Logins \(also known as Passcards\) and your SafeNotes in two different places, so you will need to go through this export/import process twice - once for each. Once successfully imported into Passpack, your Passcards and SafeNotes will be unified.

**Before proceeding, make sure you do not have your Passcards organized in folders in Roboform. If you do, the import will fail. You'll need to drag the Passcards out of the folders in Roboform before proceeding with the steps below.**

#### Export Logins \(Passcards\) from Roboform

From the Roboform toolbar in your browser, choose Roboform &gt; Logins &gt; Print List. A new window will open. Tick off the Full URL checkbox in the upper right hand corner, then press the Save button. Save the file to your desktop and name it "passcards".

#### Export SafeNotes from Roboform

From the Roboform toolbar in your browser, choose Roboform &gt; SafeNotes &gt; Print List. A new window will open. Press the Save button. Save the file to your desktop and name it "safenotes".

#### Getting Your Data

Roboform will automatically save these files as HTML pages, but for Passpack, you'll want to copy the complete source code. If you don't what source code is, that's ok, just follow these steps:

* Locate the file you saved \(either passcards.htm or safenotes.htm\) and double click it to open it.
* Once open, choose View &gt; HTML from your browser's menu \(Firefox users, choose View &gt; Page Source and Safari users, choose View &gt; View Source\). Congratulations - you're now looking at the source code!
* Select all and copy it.

#### Importing Into Passpack

In your Passpack account, choose Tools &gt; Import and select either the Roboform Logins/Passcards or theRoboform SafeNotes option \(depending on which one you're doing now of course\).

Paste your copied source code into the blue box and press the Continue button. If there are any problems, this is when Passpack will let you know. If it's anything you cant figure out, just ask for help.

If everything is ok, Passpack will show you a preview. Make sure that the values are in the order you expect them to be, press Continue and they will be added to your Passpack account. Or press Cancel and you can start over.

Press the red Save my pack button - this is important. Once everything is properly saved, you should delete the passcards.htm and safenotes.htm files from your computer immediately.

### How to export from your browser, import into Passpack?



#### Firefox

You could use this script or, much easier, install the [Password Exporter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/password-exporter/?src=search), a dedicated Firefox extension. It allows you to export your saved passwords to an XML file. You'll need to convert that to a CSV file, then follow the instructions to import into Passpack.

#### Explorer

IE Password View to extract all the passwords stored in your browser, and can export into several formats, including tab-delimited text files \(TSV\) and XML files. Then follow the instructions to import into Passpack..o import passwords into Passpack?
