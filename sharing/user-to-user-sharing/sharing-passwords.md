# Share a Password

Click on an entry in your password list. This will open the Entry window. On the right-hand side, you'll see three tabs. Click **Sharing**. You should then see a list of people that you can share with.

To share your password entry with a person in the list, simply tick the box next to their name. Two additional options will appear.

Choose **view only** and you will allow the person to see and use autologin for the password, but not make any changes\(this is the default\).

Choose **view & modify** to allow the other person to make and save changes to your entry.

_Any changes made to the entry will automatically available to both of you, as well as to anyone one else you are sharing the same entry with._

Press the **OK** button when you're done.
