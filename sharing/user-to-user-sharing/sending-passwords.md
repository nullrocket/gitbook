**\(1\)** Type the email of the recipient. Passpack will send this person a notification with a link where they can go and securely pick up the password entry.

**\(2\)** Type your name as you'd like it to appear in the notification. This should be something the recipient will recognize you by.

**\(3\)** Type a short message to accompany the notification.

**\(4\)** Choose a 5 digit PIN number. The recipient must provide this PIN in order to pick up the password entry. You'll want to tell the person the PIN number in a separate communication. Best by phone or SMS. But no matter what _don't include the PIN in the message itself_.

**\(5\)** Press **Send Now!** and Passpack will take care of the rest.

#### What Happens Next

Passpack will send an email with a link to a page where the recipient can insert the PIN and retrieve the passwords you've sent. Like an ATM PIN number, if the recipient gets it wrong three times in a row, they don't get in \(in fact, Passpack will destroy all traces of the sent password copies should that happen and you'll have to start over\).

Once entered the correct PIN, they can either login or sign up for Passpack and the password will automatically be pre-populated for them. There's also an export to CSV for people who use a different password manager, or even a printable version.

**Tip you can send many entries at once by using the Bulk edit feature. This is useful to set up a staff members with a pre-populated account or to quickly get clients up and running with Passpack.**

## **Send a Copy of a Password Entry to Another Passpack Account**

This feature allows you to send a copy of any of your password entries to someone else with a Passpack account. If you'd like to send a copy to someone _without_ a Passpack account, that's ok, just read this article instead.

By using the Attach to message link in the Entry Window, a copy of the entry will sent as an attachment on aSecure Message to the person of your choice. You must first make sure you have [activated Passpack's _Secure Sharing_](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200730564-How-to-Activate-Secure-Collaboration-Features) then [invite someone to connect](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200816630-How-to-Invite-People-to-Connect) in your People tab.

**\(1\)** Choose the name of the person from the dropdown list that you would like to send the entry to. Only people listed under your People tab will be available.

**\(2\)** Add a short note for your friend, no longer than 500 characters. This is message that your friend will receive in her Messages tab, with the password entry as an attachment on this message.

**\(3\)** Notes are not automatically included. If you would like to include the Notes as well, tick the include notes too checkbox. Tags will never be included.

**\(4\)** Press the Send Now button when you are done. As soon as you confirm on the next screen, the message with password attachment will be immediately delivered to your friend's Passpack account.

### Can I Change My Password Entry After Sending?

Sure. When you send a password entry, you are sending a _duplicate_ copy of the entry exactly the way it was the moment you sent it. Any changes you make after the fact will have NO effect on the copy that your friend now has. Also any changes your friend makes to her copy of the entry will have NO effect on your Passpack account.

**If you would like all changes to automatically be available to the other person, we suggest you use the password sharing feature instead.**

### What Happens If I Delete My Entry?

Deleting the entry from your Passpack account will delete your copy only and will have NO effect on your friend's copy. You can not "take back" a password entry once you send it, so be careful.

**If you would like to maintain control of a password and be able to revoke access to it, we suggest you use the password sharing feature instead.**

### Is There a Log of What I Sent, and to Whom?

A copy of the message you sent and the password entry attachment will be placed under your Messages tab. The attached entry will not change over time.
