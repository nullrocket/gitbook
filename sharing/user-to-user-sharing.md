# User to User Sharing

To share a password with someone, or to allow them to share with you - you need to first do a little bit of set up. Once set up is complete, you can share a password with someone very quickly from inside the [Entry window](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200814020-The-Password-Entry-Window).

## First-Time Set Up

To get set up for password sharing, follow these steps:

1. **Activate collaboration.** Click the _People_ tab and follow [the instructions](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200730564-How-to-Activate-Secure-Collaboration-Features).
2. **Add People.** Click the _People_ tab, then press the _Invite a person_ button**.** [Instructions here](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200816630-How-to-Invite-People-to-Connect).
3. **Start Sharing with Someone.** Click the _People_ tab, then _Start Sharing_ with a person.

You only have to go through this process once. Afterwards, you can share passwords very quickly from within your Entry window.

## Share a Password

Click on an entry in your password list. This will open the Entry window. On the right-hand side, you'll see three tabs. Click **Sharing**. You should then see a list of people that you can share with. \(If the person you'd like to share with is not in the list, you may need to  follow steps 2 and 3 above\).

To share your password entry with a person in the list, simply tick the box next to their name. Two additional options will appear.

Choose **view only** and you will allow the person to see and use autologin for the password, but not make any changes\(this is the default\).

Choose **view & modify** to allow the other person to make and save changes to your entry.

_Any changes made to the entry will automatically available to both of you, as well as to anyone one else you are sharing the same entry with._

Press the **OK** button when you're done.

## **Securely Send Passwords to Any Email**

Password entries can be sent either to another Passpack user, or to anyone with an email address.This is perfect for sending passwords to folks that don't have a Passpack account yet. To send a single password entry, click the it in your password list to open the entry window.

**\(1\)** Type the email of the recipient. Passpack will send this person a notification with a link where they can go and securely pick up the password entry.

**\(2\)** Type your name as you'd like it to appear in the notification. This should be something the recipient will recognize you by.

**\(3\)** Type a short message to accompany the notification.

**\(4\)** Choose a 5 digit PIN number. The recipient must provide this PIN in order to pick up the password entry. You'll want to tell the person the PIN number in a separate communication. Best by phone or SMS. But no matter what _don't include the PIN in the message itself_.

**\(5\)** Press **Send Now!** and Passpack will take care of the rest.

#### What Happens Next

Passpack will send an email with a link to a page where the recipient can insert the PIN and retrieve the passwords you've sent. Like an ATM PIN number, if the recipient gets it wrong three times in a row, they don't get in \(in fact, Passpack will destroy all traces of the sent password copies should that happen and you'll have to start over\).

Once entered the correct PIN, they can either login or sign up for Passpack and the password will automatically be pre-populated for them. There's also an export to CSV for people who use a different password manager, or even a printable version.

**Tip you can send many entries at once by using the Bulk edit feature. This is useful to set up a staff members with a pre-populated account or to quickly get clients up and running with Passpack.**

## **Send a Copy of a Password Entry to Another Passpack Account**

This feature allows you to send a copy of any of your password entries to someone else with a Passpack account. If you'd like to send a copy to someone _without_ a Passpack account, that's ok, just read this article instead.

By using the Attach to message link in the Entry Window, a copy of the entry will sent as an attachment on aSecure Message to the person of your choice. You must first make sure you have [activated Passpack's _Secure Sharing_](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200730564-How-to-Activate-Secure-Collaboration-Features) then [invite someone to connect](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200816630-How-to-Invite-People-to-Connect) in your People tab.

### How To Send the Password Entry

To send a password entry, go to the Passwords tab. You will see a list of all the entries that you have already saved. Click on the name of the entry that you would like to send to open the Entry Window. Click the Attach to message link in the lower right-hand corner.

![](/assets/assets%2F-LCBoecSUMMtKc_rFkkd%2F-LFEnYTJYxAUr1EVlzRs%2F-LFEqs0dW3ORuOkMZ07H%2Fattachentry.jpg)

**\(1\)** Choose the name of the person from the dropdown list that you would like to send the entry to. Only people listed under your People tab will be available.

**\(2\)** Add a short note for your friend, no longer than 500 characters. This is message that your friend will receive in her Messages tab, with the password entry as an attachment on this message.

**\(3\)** Notes are not automatically included. If you would like to include the Notes as well, tick the include notes too checkbox. Tags will never be included.

**\(4\)** Press the Send Now button when you are done. As soon as you confirm on the next screen, the message with password attachment will be immediately delivered to your friend's Passpack account.

### Can I Change My Password Entry After Sending?

Sure. When you send a password entry, you are sending a _duplicate_ copy of the entry exactly the way it was the moment you sent it. Any changes you make after the fact will have NO effect on the copy that your friend now has. Also any changes your friend makes to her copy of the entry will have NO effect on your Passpack account.

**If you would like all changes to automatically be available to the other person, we suggest you use the password sharing feature instead.**

### What Happens If I Delete My Entry?

Deleting the entry from your Passpack account will delete your copy only and will have NO effect on your friend's copy. You can not "take back" a password entry once you send it, so be careful.

**If you would like to maintain control of a password and be able to revoke access to it, we suggest you use the password sharing feature instead.**

### Is There a Log of What I Sent, and to Whom?

A copy of the message you sent and the password entry attachment will be placed under your Messages tab. The attached entry will not change over time.

## **How to STOP Sharing with Someone**

### To Stop Sharing a Single Entry

Locate the entry in your password list and click on it to open it. from within the Entry window, click the sharing tab to the right. You will see a list of people. Those people that you are currently sharing the entry with will have a check next to their name:

To stop sharing this password with a person, simply uncheck the checkbox next to thier name, then press the **OK** button in the entry window to apply the changes.

Do this separately for each of the entires that you'd like to stop sharing with a person.

> TIP: To quickly find all the entries you are sharing with a given person, you can use the Quick Filters in your password list. In your password tabs, look to the left of youer password list. Near the bottom right of the Quick Filters box, click the **show more** link. Click the **plus sign** next to the **You shared** item. This will show you a list of names of people you are actively sharing with. Click on the person's name you are intersted in. Your password list will now only show those entries you are sharing with that particular person.

### Immediately Stop Sharing ALL Entries with Someone

Under your **People** tab, locate the person's name. Click on the **Stop Sharing** link. This will immediately break _all sharing_ you have with this person.

For Example, in the image above Tara Kelly would no longer see any of your passwords that you had shared with her. But _you_ would also stop seeing anything that tara had previously shared with you. It's a two-way street.

Should you choose, in the future you could start sharing with Tara again.

## **I Can't Share With Someone in My People Tab. Why?**

There are two different types of people in your **People** tab:

1. **People you can send messages and copies of your passwords too** You can add as many of these people as you'd like. There's no limit.  
2. **People you can truly share passwords with \(not copies or attachments - real, live sharing\)** You will see an orange or black "sharing" label next to the person's name:  ![](http://www.passpack.net/gallery/albums/passpack-7/People-SharedPerson.png)

If you'd like to share passwords with someone, simply click the start sharing link near their name. From this point on, the person's name should appear in the sharing tab of your entries.

There may be restrictions on the number of people you can choose to share with depending on if you have a Free or paid account.
