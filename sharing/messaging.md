## **About the Messages Tab**

The Messages tab is where you can see all of your secure message exchanges. From here, you can send messages, recieve new messages and archive existing messages. If you would like to attach a password entry to a message, [read these instructions](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200816660-Send-a-Copy-of-a-Password-Entry-to-Another-Passpack-Account).
