How To Check for Javascript Errors
If you've found an error in Passpack, you can help us pinpoint the problem by activating the Javascript console in your browser and reporting the error to us. Here's how to do that - thanks for your help!

Activate the Console
Google Chrome 
Click the page icon and choose Developer > Javascript Console.

Firefox 
Choose Tools > Error Console. If you already use Firebug, then you can use it's "Console" tab as well.

Safari 
Instructions vary from version to version. If you can use a different browser just for this test, we'd really appreciate it.

Opera 
From the Opera menu, choose Page > Developer Tools > Error Console.

The application Firebug lite isn't able to grab all Javascript errors. Full-fledged Firefox: yes. Firebug lite: no. Thanks.

Report Errors
With your console active, enter your Passpack account, and do whatever it was that didn't work the first time. Or if your support rep gave you specific tasks, then follow those instructions. When you're done, or if you get stuck, check the console to see if any errors were reported. Copy and paste these to your support rep. Thanks!
