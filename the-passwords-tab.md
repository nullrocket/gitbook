# The Passwords Tab

## What are the icons in my password list?

Depending on your settings, you may see six small, black icons to the right of each entry in your list. You may change these icon settings in your **Settings &gt; Appearance** menu.

Each icon represents a field in your entry window, and will be displayed in your password list. Icons let you see at a glance if a certain field in your entry has been filled out or not.

If the icon is black, the field in your entry has been filled out and you can **click on the icon to quickly copy the contents**. If the icon is gray-scale, the field is empty.

The following is a list of what each icon represents within your entry :

**User Id** \(ex. _your name, different than Sharing Nickname_\)

**Email** address associated with your entry \(ex. _yourname@yahoo.com_\)

**Password** \(ex. _JuHMNcwVgFm0_\)

**Link** to the URL address associated with entry \(ex. _www.yahoo.com_\)

**Notes**. Add extra relevant info \(ex. _frequent flier miles, reservation numbers, verbal password hint, etc._\)

**Tags**, keywords or labels to help find your entries quickly \(ex. _blog, forum, travel_\)

When you do a quick search, if the field in your entry contains the word you searched for, the black icon will be filled in with yellow.

#### How To Copy the Password?

You can click on any one of the icons to immediately copy content so that you can paste it elsewhere. This can be useful when, for example, you are unable to use the _Passpack It!_ button. Simply click the password icon for the entry in your list, then paste it into the website's login form.

## About the passwords tab.

The Passwords tab is where you can see your list of passwords. From here you can delete password entries, add new ones or modify existing ones. On the right-hand side of your list, you have various options for searching and filtering your password list, including Tags.

### The Password List

This is the heart of your Passpack account. It is where you see all of your password entries that you have saved in your account. You can make many changes simply by clicking icons directly in the password list:

* Mark as Favorite by clicking its star icon in the password list.
* Change the Security Level of an entry by clicking its lock icon in the password list.
* Quick delete an entry by clicking the trashcan to the right.
* Jump to the relative website by clicking the Go button.
* Click on any of the content icons to copy it.

In addition, you can click on any Title in your password list to open the Entry Window. There you can modify password entry, including Title, User ID, Email, Password, Tags, Notes, Security, Favorites and Sharing __options. You may also choose to send a copy of the entry to a person you trust.

By default, your password list will have 15 rows. You can change this setting under **Settings &gt; Appearance**. If you have more than this amount of passwords saved, you may need to use the search feature, browse by tags, or use the alphabetical order buttons to locate the password entry you are looking for.

### Search

This is best when you know exactly what you're looking for. In the example below, we searched for all "Amazon" account logins.  

Once you begin typing, the **search** button will appear. Press it, or hit enter on your keyboard to find what you're looking for in your password list. It doesn't matter if the word shows up in the Title, User ID, Email, Password or Notes. If you typed "Amazon" anywhere in your entry, Passpack will find it \(and highlight the corresponding icon\) for you.

### Next, Previous, and Alphabetical Order Buttons

To flip from page to page, use the Next Page and Previous Page buttons below your list. Passpack also uses alphabetical order buttons that show you the first three letters of the first entry on that page. It's very similar to the way things work at your local library. Click one of these buttons to jump straight to any page. 

### Quick Filters

The panel below the search box contains some filters. Clicking on any item in the list will filter your password list. Click on the star to view ONLY your Favorites. Click on one of the locks to view ONLY passwords with a certain security level.

### Tag List & Tag Cloud

Did you ever get that frustrating feeling when you can't remember a word \(you can almost remember it, it starts with a "C" or maybe a "D"\) but it has to do with your online profiles that's it's PROFILE! 

If you frequently tag your entries, you're in luck. Just click on the "profile" tag next to one of your entries, or in your tag list to your right. Passpack will pull up all entries tagged with "profile" and highlight the tag, and the tag icon in yellow for you. You can label your entries with as many tags as you want. 

You can choose to see an entry's tags directly in the password list or not. You can set your preference under **Settings &gt; Appearance**.

### Save All Button

By default, Passpack automatically saves your changes for you. However there are times when this is not possible. Should you need to save any changes manually, the Save All button will become bright red. If the button is not red, there are no changes to be saved.

### Undo All Button

If you accidentally deleted an entry, or made any other mistakes and your changes have not yet been saved, you can still undo the mistake. If the Undo All button is clickable, then press it to revert ALL changes since the last time you saved. If you made many changes, this will revert them all. Be careful, as you can not undo an undo.

Alternatively, you can undo mistakes one by one by using the leftmost arrow next to a changed entry in the password list.
