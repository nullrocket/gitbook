# Deletion



## **Abandoned Accounts**

Free accounts left abandoned for six _consecutive_ months, are subject to being deleted. As long as you login to your account at least once every six months \(perhaps five months would be a safer bet\), this will not effect you.

We are often lenient about the six month rule, so please don't rely heavily on the fact that inactive free accounts are deleted on the six month mark. They may be kept alive for much longer. It's not an automated process, we simply go through from time to time and clean out abandoned accounts. 

### Does This Apply to Paid Accounts Too?

No. When you pay for an account, you pay for a full year. It does not matter if you use it or not, it will not be deleted during that year. 

### What If I Stop Paying for My Account?

Should your paid account come up for renewal, and you chose not to renew it, it will be considered a Free account again. So if a non-renewal is followed by six months of inactivity, it will be subject to deletion just like any other Free account.

## **Can I Delete My Account to Start Over?**

### 1. Did you associate an email with your account?

**YES**, proceed to \#2.

**NO**, skip to \#3. 

### 2. Do You Remember Your Packing Key? 

**YES**. If you have created an account and forgotten the _User ID_ or _Password_, but remember your _Packing Key_, you [can use this form to regain access to your account](https://www.passpack.com/reset).

**MAYBE**. If you have ever changed your _Packing Key_ and **you remember the old one**, but not the new one, [then follow these instructions](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200749184). If you have never changed your Packing Key, or if you do not remember the old one, then proceed to \#3.

**NO**, There are a few things which can sometimes interfere with the _Packing Key_ as you're typing, so [check to see if any of the things listed in this article could be the case.](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200743094) If you are still unable to access your account, proceed to \#3.

### 3. Do You Have a Free or a Paid Account?

**FREE**. Since the cancellation of an account can not be undone, to cancel an account we need to be absolutely certain that you are the rightful owner of the account. Alas, email alone is not sufficient to ensure your identity. Why? Well, imagine if someone gets hold of your inbox, they might ask us to cancel your account. So, for the safety of all our users, we can not service your request to delete your account.

[Please create another account with a different User ID](https://www.passpack.com/signup). You can have as many free accounts as you'd like, and the unused account will eventually be considered abandoned. Abandoned accounts will be deleted automatically after six consecutive months of inactivity. While we understand you may be attached to your favorite User ID, this is the best we can do for you.

**PAID**. We may be able to accommodate you since we have more than just an email on file for you. Please follow this procedure to begin the process, it is necessary so that we can move your billing information and schedule from the old to the new account:

1. Create a new free account, with a different _User ID_.
2. [Contact support](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), make sure to include:
   * Your old User ID, associated with the account you have already paid for
   * The new User ID, associated with the free account from step 1
   * The email associated with both accounts
   * Your name or business name you provided to Paypal at the time of payment
   * The type of package you purchased \(Pro, Group or Team\) and approximate date of purchase
3. We will then be in contact with further instructions.

## **How to Delete Your Passpack Account**

Provided that you know your login credentials, including your Packing Key, you as a user have the ability to delete your Passpack account at your discretion. If however, you do not know your Packing Key and do not qualify for a roll back, we cannot do anything to assist you with logging in or to delete your account for you. If you have a paid level account we can however, transfer the payment information to a new account for you. If you delete your account, all of your data is completely and irreversibly removed from Passpack's servers. It cannot be undone. All information that was previously stored is gone. We strongly recommend that you export or backup your data prior to any account deletion.

### Account Deletion

To delete your account, you must have access to your Passpack account.

Sign into your Passpack account. Click on your "**Account**" tab then click the "delete your account" link in the lower left hand corner of the page. You will then be asked to insert your Packing Key before proceeding. Click "**Delete**" to permanently delete your account. If at any point prior to clicking on "**Delete**" you change your mind or need to delay deleting, just click anywhere else on the screen and the "Delete" screen will disappear.

### Abandoned Accounts

All Free level accounts that have not been actively signed into for six months or longer, will automatically be purged from the system. If you are unable to sign into your Free account it will eventually be deleted on its own.
