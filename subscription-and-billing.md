# Subscription and Billing

## How do I upgrade my plan?

To upgrade to any paid level account, go to **Account &gt; Pricing & Packages** to select a plan and make a new payment. Once you have upgraded, payments for your paid level account are due annually to maintain the same. Your credit card will _not_ be charged automatically. When the time grows near to renew your account, Passpack will begin sending you reminder emails. Follow the instructions in the email, or go to **Account &gt; Pricing & Packages** to make a new payment.

## Do you accept credit cards?

We accept all major credit cards via Paypal.  Paypal may allow you to use a credit card in some instances without a Paypal account, this is at their discretion. Some of the reasons the option may not be available are listed below.

* You have used the credit card optional feature to pay several times \(Paypal may require that you create an account\)
* The country your customers reside in.   Not all countries have all PayPal features available. 
* The IP address of your hosted site is on a blocked list. 

## How to download your invoices?

 A few days after your payment, an invoice will be posted to your account. This generally takes between 2-3 business days. To see or download your invoices, go to **Account &gt; Invoices** from within your Passpack account. 

## I have a promocode, how do I use it?

Congratulations! People with a _promocode_ have usually won a contest, or have done something extraordinary. Usually a promocode entitles you to a discount, an upgrade or additional services on your Passpack account. Each promocode is unique and can be used only once.

#### How to Use Your Promocode

If you don't have a Passpack account yet, sign up for a free account before continuing. From inside your Passpack account, go to **Account &gt; Packages & Pricing** link in the upper-right hand corner of your screen. The pricing table will appear.

If you have a promocode for a Free+ account, or for additional services on your Free account, click the link **Have a Free+ promocode?** in the _Free_ column. Enter your promocode in the filed that appears and press the OK button.

If you have a discount or free upgrade on a paid account, enter your promocode in the field in the appropriate column then press the red **Buy Now** button. If there is no payment due, you do not have to provide any payment information.

That's it, you're account should be immediately updated. 

#### Frequently Asked Promocode Questions

## Is there a free trial on paid plans?

There's no need. Go ahead and sign up for a Free account. You may use it for as long as like \(even forever\), then upgrade to a paid account when you're ready. We're not rushing you.

\*Requests made after 30 days will not be approved. We are sorry, but there are no partial or prorated refunds after the 30 day period. 

#### Your Account will be Downgraded to "Free". What that Means...

If you request a refund and one is processed, your account will be downgraded to a Free account. Please remember that Free level plans only store up to 100 password entries. Please be sure you have exported any important data from your Passpack account before requesting a refund to prevent data retention issues.

You may continue to use the Free downgraded account for as long as you'd like, or if you wish, you may delete it.
