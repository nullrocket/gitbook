#### How To See Your Favorites

In the Quick Filters pane to the left of your password list, click on the **Favorites** link. This will filter your password list to show any and all web favorites. Clicking on the **Mobile favorites** link will filter your password list to show any and all mobile favorites.

#### Make Passpack.com Faster with Favorites

If you have a very active account \(with 50 entries or more\), you may start to notice that Passpack can become slow to load right after you sign in. This is because there are many password entries to unpack \(decrypt\) all at once.

To make Passpack load more quickly, you can set the most used entries as Web Favorites. Then go to **Settings &gt; Startup Options** and choose one of the following options:

1. _Just unpack my favorites_ \(the ones with stars\) This will only load your Favorites. To load your other entries, you will need to do so manually.
2. _Just unpack my favorites_ - then turn on 1 Click Login for my favorites only This is similar to option \#1, however it will also automatically activate 1 Click Login for you. Only your Favorites will be available for 1 Click Login.
3. _First unpack my favorites_ - then unpack the rest in the background This will load your Favorites first, show them in your list, then continue to load the rest of your entries so that you don't have to do so manually.
4. _First unpack my favorites_ - then turn on 1 Click Login - then unpack the rest in the background This is a combination of option \#2 and \#3. Your favorites will load first, and 1 Click Login activated for them right away. Then Passpack will continue to load the rest of your entries so that you don't have to do so manually. once that is complete, ALL of your entries will available for 1 Click Login.

### Frequent questions about tags.

Instead of categories, or folders for organizing entries, Passpack uses Tags. If you are not familiar with tags, tag surfing or tag clouds, then read on.

#### What Is a Tag?

Tags are mini, one-word descriptions that you use to label your entries.

#### Why Are Tags Useful?

Using tags helps you keep your passwords organized, and locate them more quickly.

#### How Do I Add a Tag?

When adding or editing an entry, look down near the bottom of the entry window and you'll see a Tags field. Type in one tag at a time separated by a space - **tags can't contain spaces**, they are limited to one word only. Think of them as "mini labels" if you will.

If you want to use a tag that is typically expressed as two or more words, you can lump them together \(ex. pokergame\) or use a dash \(ex. poker-game\). If you write "poker game" it'll be considered two different tags: "poker" and "game".

You can add as many tags as you'd like, and Passpack will also suggest your previously used tags as you type. Here's what that looks like: 

#### I Added a Tag, Now What?

The first time you add a tag, you'll notice an extra column will be added to your password list that contains your tags. You can choose to hide this column on the **Settings &gt; Appearance** screen. Also, to the right of your list, you'll see what's called a _Tag Cloud_.![](http://www.passpack.net/gallery/zp-core/i.php?a=passpack-7&i=TagCloud.png) 

The more tags you use, the more your cloud will be comprised of. The tags you use most are bigger than the others.

Don't like the cloud? Then simply click on the list view link. This will present your tags in a list, all the same size, and in alphabetical order.![](http://www.passpack.net/gallery/zp-core/i.php?a=passpack-7&i=TagList.png) 

#### How Do I "Tag Surf"?

If you would like to see all entries for a given tag, you can click on the tag from either in the tag column in your password list, or in the tag cloud. Passpack will filter all of your entries showing you only those with that tag - it's lightning fast. 

#### Tips & Tricks for Using Tags Well

Here are some examples for using tags:

> All websites where you maintain a public "about me" profile, might get tagged with the word **profile**. By clicking the profile tag you can see what sites you may want to visit to make sure your current profile information is up to date.

> All shopping sites might get tagged **shopping**, and then possibly also with the type of items they sell, e.g. **books**,**clothes**, **flowers**, etc.

> You can also store important phone or fax numbers, or email addresses in an entry instead of a website link. Tag these **contact**. If it's a customer support number, you may also tag it **support**. If it's emergency information \(like the phone number for stolen credit cards\) tag it **911**.

> Storing software registration keys and activation numbers is another use. These could get tagged **software**. If the info also contains a link to a support forum, add the tag **support** as well.

The trick to tags is simply using whatever immediately comes to mind for the entry. You can always remove tags or add new ones. 

### Tags not showing up in shared entries.

**Common question**

> "I'd like my collaborator to be able to see the tags that I have created in the entry I shared with him. However, he is not able to see them. Is there a setting that will allow him to see the tags that I have created?"

**Answer**

Tags will not be shared because they're considered "personal". We've been having some internal conversations about whether or not this is the correct approach for our users moving forward.

## Filtering

### How to quickly find your entries?

Did you ever get that frustrating feeling when you can't remember a word... you can _almost_ remember it... it starts with a "C"? ... or maybe a "D"? ... no, no ... but it has to do with your online profiles, you're _sure_ of it - that's it... PROFILE!

If you frequently tag your entries, you're in luck. Just click on the "profile"? tag next to one of your entries, or in your tag list on the left hand side of your screen. Passpack will pull up all entries tagged with "profile"? and highlight the tag, and the tag icon in yellow for you. You can label your entries with as many tags as you want.

You can also use the Quick Search. Just start typing "profile"? and Passpack will narrow down the results for you.

#### An Alphabetical Order List

There are times when you are just browsing, or maybe you clicked on a tag that pulled up 2-3 pages of entries. Either way, to pass from page to page, just use the _next_ _page_ and _previous page_ buttons below your list.

Passpack uses _alphabetical order buttons_ that show you the first three letters of the first entry on that page. It's very similar to the way things work at your local library.
