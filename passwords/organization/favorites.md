# Favorites

If you have a very active account \(with 50 entries or more\), you may start to notice that Passpack can become slow to load right after you sign in. This is because there are many password entries to unpack \(decrypt\) all at once.

To make Passpack load more quickly, you can set the most used entries as Web Favorites. Then go to **Settings &gt; Startup Options** and choose one of the following options:

1. _Just unpack my favorites_ \(the ones with stars\) This will only load your Favorites. To load your other entries, you will need to do so manually.
2. _Just unpack my favorites_ - then turn on 1 Click Login for my favorites only This is similar to option \#1, however it will also automatically activate 1 Click Login for you. Only your Favorites will be available for 1 Click Login.
3. _First unpack my favorites_ - then unpack the rest in the background This will load your Favorites first, show them in your list, then continue to load the rest of your entries so that you don't have to do so manually.
4. _First unpack my favorites_ - then turn on 1 Click Login - then unpack the rest in the background This is a combination of option \#2 and \#3. Your favorites will load first, and 1 Click Login activated for them right away. Then Passpack will continue to load the rest of your entries so that you don't have to do so manually. once that is complete, ALL of your entries will available for 1 Click Login.

## Setting Favorites

If you'd like to mark a password entry as a _Favorite_, simply click on the _star icon_ in your password list under the Password tab.
