## Filtering

Did you ever get that frustrating feeling when you can't remember a word... you can _almost_ remember it... it starts with a "C"? ... or maybe a "D"? ... no, no ... but it has to do with your online profiles, you're _sure_ of it - that's it... PROFILE!

If you frequently tag your entries, you're in luck. Just click on the "profile"? tag next to one of your entries, or in your tag list on the left hand side of your screen. Passpack will pull up all entries tagged with "profile"? and highlight the tag, and the tag icon in yellow for you. You can label your entries with as many tags as you want.

You can also use the Quick Search. Just start typing "profile"? and Passpack will narrow down the results for you.

## Quick Filters

In your **Passwords** tab, to the left of your password list, you'll see the **Quick Filters** box. Clicking on any of the items in this box will temporarily change the entries being viewed in your list to only those you've selected. For example, if you'd like to only see your favorite entries \(ones you use frequently\), click **Favorites** in your **Quick Filter** box. It's very simple.

By default, it looks something like the image on the left. The image on the right shows a full **Quick Filter**box, including sharing options.

Clicking the small **show more** and **show less** link to the bottom right of the box, will expand or collapse the box.

The number in parenthesis is the number of entries that will be listed for each item.

* **All Unpacked Entries** For most people, this means _all_ of your entries. Clicking this will remove any previous filters. Users who have set up advanced startup options will only see those entries which have been unpacked.  
* **Favorites** Click on this to only see the entries that you've marked as favorites. If you do not have any favorites, the link will not be clickable.  
* **Security Level** Passpack allows you to set up to three security levels for your entries. This is option, and by default your passwords will be protected with the highest level available. Click the plus sign next to see the three different security levels. If you've changed the security level of any of your entries, click one of the options to list them.  
* **All shared, You shared & Shared with you** If you do not see these options - it's okay. that simply means that you are not sharing any of your passwords with anyone else, and no one is sharing their passwords with you. 
  * **All shared**  Will list passwords that either you are sharing with others, or they are sharing with you. Click the plus sign to see the names of all people involved in sharing. You may also then click on a person's name to see all entries shared between the two of you.
  * **You shared** Will only list your passwords that you have decided to share with other people.
  * **Shared with you** Will only list your passwords that you have received in sharing from other people. These entries are not yours, they are "lent" to you by others.
