## Filtering

### How to quickly find your entries?

Did you ever get that frustrating feeling when you can't remember a word... you can _almost_ remember it... it starts with a "C"? ... or maybe a "D"? ... no, no ... but it has to do with your online profiles, you're _sure_ of it - that's it... PROFILE!

If you frequently tag your entries, you're in luck. Just click on the "profile"? tag next to one of your entries, or in your tag list on the left hand side of your screen. Passpack will pull up all entries tagged with "profile"? and highlight the tag, and the tag icon in yellow for you. You can label your entries with as many tags as you want.

You can also use the Quick Search. Just start typing "profile"? and Passpack will narrow down the results for you.

#### An Alphabetical Order List

There are times when you are just browsing, or maybe you clicked on a tag that pulled up 2-3 pages of entries. Either way, to pass from page to page, just use the _next_ _page_ and _previous page_ buttons below your list.

Passpack uses _alphabetical order buttons_ that show you the first three letters of the first entry on that page. It's very similar to the way things work at your local library.
