### How to quickly find your entries?

Did you ever get that frustrating feeling when you can't remember a word... you can _almost_ remember it... it starts with a "C"? ... or maybe a "D"? ... no, no ... but it has to do with your online profiles, you're _sure_ of it - that's it... PROFILE!

If you frequently tag your entries, you're in luck. Just click on the "profile"? tag next to one of your entries, or in your tag list on the left hand side of your screen. Passpack will pull up all entries tagged with "profile"? and highlight the tag, and the tag icon in yellow for you. You can label your entries with as many tags as you want.

You can also use the Quick Search. Just start typing "profile"? and Passpack will narrow down the results for you.
