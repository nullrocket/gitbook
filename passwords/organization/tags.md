### Frequent questions about tags.

Instead of categories, or folders for organizing entries, Passpack uses Tags. If you are not familiar with tags, tag surfing or tag clouds, then read on.

#### What Is a Tag?

Tags are mini, one-word descriptions that you use to label your entries.

#### Why Are Tags Useful?

Using tags helps you keep your passwords organized, and locate them more quickly.

#### How Do I Add a Tag?

When adding or editing an entry, look down near the bottom of the entry window and you'll see a Tags field. Type in one tag at a time separated by a space - **tags can't contain spaces**, they are limited to one word only. Think of them as "mini labels" if you will.

If you want to use a tag that is typically expressed as two or more words, you can lump them together \(ex. pokergame\) or use a dash \(ex. poker-game\). If you write "poker game" it'll be considered two different tags: "poker" and "game".

You can add as many tags as you'd like, and Passpack will also suggest your previously used tags as you type. Here's what that looks like:

#### I Added a Tag, Now What?

The first time you add a tag, you'll notice an extra column will be added to your password list that contains your tags. You can choose to hide this column on the **Settings &gt; Appearance** screen. Also, to the right of your list, you'll see what's called a _Tag Cloud_.![](http://www.passpack.net/gallery/zp-core/i.php?a=passpack-7&i=TagCloud.png)

The more tags you use, the more your cloud will be comprised of. The tags you use most are bigger than the others.

Don't like the cloud? Then simply click on the list view link. This will present your tags in a list, all the same size, and in alphabetical order.![](http://www.passpack.net/gallery/zp-core/i.php?a=passpack-7&i=TagList.png)

#### How Do I "Tag Surf"?

If you would like to see all entries for a given tag, you can click on the tag from either in the tag column in your password list, or in the tag cloud. Passpack will filter all of your entries showing you only those with that tag - it's lightning fast.

#### Tips & Tricks for Using Tags Well

Here are some examples for using tags:

> All websites where you maintain a public "about me" profile, might get tagged with the word **profile**. By clicking the profile tag you can see what sites you may want to visit to make sure your current profile information is up to date.
>
> All shopping sites might get tagged **shopping**, and then possibly also with the type of items they sell, e.g. **books**,**clothes**, **flowers**, etc.
>
> You can also store important phone or fax numbers, or email addresses in an entry instead of a website link. Tag these **contact**. If it's a customer support number, you may also tag it **support**. If it's emergency information \(like the phone number for stolen credit cards\) tag it **911**.
>
> Storing software registration keys and activation numbers is another use. These could get tagged **software**. If the info also contains a link to a support forum, add the tag **support** as well.

The trick to tags is simply using whatever immediately comes to mind for the entry. You can always remove tags or add new ones.

### Tags not showing up in shared entries.

**Common question**

> "I'd like my collaborator to be able to see the tags that I have created in the entry I shared with him. However, he is not able to see them. Is there a setting that will allow him to see the tags that I have created?"

**Answer**

Tags will not be shared because they're considered "personal". We've been having some internal conversations about whether or not this is the correct approach for our users moving forward.
