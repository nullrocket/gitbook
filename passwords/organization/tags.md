# Tags

Instead of categories, or folders for organizing entries, Passpack uses Tags. Tags are mini, one-word descriptions that you use to label your entries. Using tags helps you keep your passwords organized, and locate them more quickly.

## Adding a Tag

When adding or editing an entry, look down near the bottom of the entry window and you'll see a Tags field. Type in one tag at a time separated by a space - **tags can't contain spaces**, they are limited to one word only. Think of them as "mini labels" if you will.

If you want to use a tag that is typically expressed as two or more words, you can lump them together \(ex. pokergame\) or use a dash \(ex. poker-game\). If you write "poker game" it'll be considered two different tags: "poker" and "game".

You can add as many tags as you'd like, and Passpack will also suggest your previously used tags as you type. Here's what that looks like:

## Tag Surfing

If you would like to see all entries for a given tag, you can click on the tag from either in the tag column in your password list, or in the tag cloud. Passpack will filter all of your entries showing you only those with that tag - it's lightning fast.
